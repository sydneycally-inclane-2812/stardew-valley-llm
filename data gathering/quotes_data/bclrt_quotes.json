        "Abigail lives at the general store with her parents. She sometimes fights with her mom, who worries about Abigail's \"alternative lifestyle\". Her mom has the following to say: \"I wish Abby would dress more appropriately and stop dyeing her hair blue. She has such a wonderful natural hair color, just like her grandmother did. Oh, and I wish she'd find some wholesome interests instead of this occult nonsense she's into.\" You might find Abigail alone in the graveyard, or maybe out in a rainstorm looking for frogs.",
        "Hey, you remembered my birthday... Thanks, <player>! This is really nice!",
        "Hey, you remembered my birthday... Thanks, <player>!Oh, it's, uh... *sniff*... what is it?",
        "I seriously love this! You're the best, (Name)!",
        "Wow... it's just my color! Thanks, (Name)!",
        "Thank you! This is my favorite stone. It's so pretty.",
        "Oh, wow... (Name)! Are you sure you want to give this to me? It's so rare!I'll admit, my mouth is watering already...",
        "Whoa, that's a creepy looking book... I love it!*Flip* *flip* *flip*... Ooh... It's full of monsters...I'll have to study this before going into the caves... Thanks!",
        "Wow... the color is so beautiful, like an amethyst. Thanks!",
        "Hey, how'd you know I was hungry? This looks delicious!",
        "Whoa... Where'd you find this? The workmanship is fascinating...It's a little too rusty to use, but I'll add it to my collection.",
        "Disgusting... I love it!",
        "This makes you wonder... Thousands of years ago, there was probably a little purple-haired cavewoman who played this flute, just like me....I'll have to wash it before pressing it to my lips, though.",
        "Hey, this is my favorite magazine! My Dad won't let me have a subscription, so I have to get it on the black market like this...",
        "You brought me a present? Thanks.",
        "What am I supposed to do with this?",
        "What were you thinking? This is awful!",
        "Oh that's right...I heard someone new was moving onto that old farm.It's  kind of a shame, really. I always enjoyed exploring those overgrown fields by myself.",
        "Oh, hey. Taking a break from work?",
        "Oh, hi! Do you ever hang out at the cemetery? It's a peaceful place to spend some time alone.",
        "Ugh... I'm not in a good mood right now.I said I'm not in a good mood... what do you want?",
        "...*sigh*... I know my parents mean well, but sometimes they just cannot understand my point of view. Weren't they ever young?",
        "Hey. Sorry in advance if I say anything rude. I didn't get much sleep last night. What do you want?",
        "Oh no, I think my Dad's going to cook dinner tonight... I don't feel like doing anything today...",
        "The fresh mountain air is nice on a day like this. I wonder if the frogs will make an appearance soon.",
        "Oh, hi [Player]. Taking a break from your work? Me too. Oh! Nothing physical... just some online classes I'm taking.",
        "Hi, I'm glad to see you. I want to take my mind off things for a while... how is your day going?",
        "Wow, I just realized it's Friday.  Sometimes I totally lose track of time.",
        "We're all going to hang out in the saloon this evening. It's kind of like a Friday tradition, I guess.",
        "Oh man... I've been pushing off my homework all weekend. Looks like I'll be pulling another all-nighter...",
        "We're hiding in here so we don't have to talk to anyone",
        "Hey. We had one of those [items] you sold at the shop for dinner last night... I guess it was starting to go bad and my Dad couldn't bear to throw it out. Unfortunately it tasted like [adjective].",
        "Hey. We had one of those [items] you sold at the shop for dinner last night... I guess it was starting to go bad and my Dad couldn't bear to throw it out. It was still pretty good, though.",
        "You came all this way to visit me? That's nice. So have you been exploring the mountain caves at all? Interesting. I'd like to go there myself one of these days.",
        "The birds were happily chirping today. They're too simple to understand the future.It's better to be like them, isn't it?",
        "...Oh, [Player]! Hi. Want to hang out for a while? Here! Let me read your palm. *giggle* ",
        "I can't trust a person who doesn't like animals...Oh, don't worry! I know you're an animal lover!",
        "Ugh... I have a doctor's appointment later.",
        "I'm just here for my annual check-up! Don't worry, I'm not preg... I mean, I'm not sick! Heh.",
        "How much longer do you need, doc? I'm hungry.",
        "Summer's here. It's not really my favorite season. The air is so muggy I feel like I'm floating in soup.",
        "My pet guinea pig, David, just hates this hot weather. He's fussy.",
        "The air is so thick with honey and nectar all summer. I almost feel dizzy.",
        "Have you decorated your house at all? That's what I'd be doing if I had a house.",
        "I went to the beach last night, after dark... Sometimes you can see strange lights bobbing over the sea. Or maybe that was just a dream I had... It doesn't feel real anymore.",
        "If I knew how to use a sword I would be exploring those caves by the mountain lake right now. It's probably nice and cool in there.",
        "Ew, I hope I don't get a tan this summer.",
        "I kind of wish I had a cat. Unfortunately, my Dad is allergic to pretty much everything.",
        "I'm looking forward to fall... the cool mountain breeze, the swirling red petals, the smell of mushrooms... *sigh*",
        "Do you ever get an urge to go exploring, [Player]?",
        "I would love to live in an old farmhouse like you. The creak of a floorboard, the slow plumes of dust whispering through the rafters... There's something special about an old building, isn't there?",
        "You're an interesting [guy/lady], [Player]. I'm glad you moved here.",
        "I'm actually enjoying myself this summer. It's funny how quickly one's outlook can change.",
        "I used to think Pelican Town was kinda drab, but lately I'm starting to love some things about it.",
        "Ah... Fall's here! I was getting so tired of summer.",
        "I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air today.",
        "I try to help out in the shop on most days. Business has been pretty bad since the Joja Mart opened, though.",
        "I can't wait to see some pumpkins this year. The spirit's eve festival happens at the end of the season. It's pretty low-key compared to what you'd see in Zuzu City, but for a small town like this it's a lot of fun.",
        "Last night, I dreamt that my left hand had turned into a gigantic [random object]... Does that mean anything?",
        "Do you have any scarecrows on your farm?",
        "Are you growing pumpkins on your farm this year? Save one for me!",
        "I may fight with my parents a lot, but I know they're just looking out for me. They're doing what they think is best. I dunno why I'm saying this to you. Don't tell anyone.",
        "Ever since Joja Mart shut down we've been doing great at the shop!",
        "I can't believe you fixed up that old Community Center all by yourself. I'm really impressed.",
        "Hi. Your hair looks cool today... did you do something different?",
        "I wish the season lasted a little longer. When the wind really picks up, I almost feel like a kid again.",
        "You know, I could actually see myself becoming a farmer some day... But how would that ever happen? *chuckle*",
        "Well, fall is over... But I like winter, too!",
        "It's just too cold to go outside much. But I do enjoy building a snowgoon.",
        "Doesn't a steaming hot cup of cocoa sound good right now?",
        "Hi. Is it boring to be a farmer during the winter?",
        "It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year.",
        "Another year is almost over. It goes by so fast, doesn't it?",
        "One thing I've learned living here... everyone stares at you if you look different.",
        "It's the weekend! That means I can play twice as many video games. Bye.",
        "Hi. If you're ever bored, you can always hang out in my room. As long as I'm not changing, of course!",
        "It's so cold, I wish we had a hot cup of cocoa to share.",
        "I've been daydreaming a lot lately... Oh! You want to know what it's about? Well... ...It's a secret.",
        "It must be nice not having crops to worry about this time of year. And that means you can hang out with me more often!",
        "The valley looks more interesting in the rain... don't you think?",
        "I want to go exploring, but I can tell my Mom is kind of worried. I don't want to add to her stress.",
        "Have you seen all the crazy trees around town? Everything looks so different... I feel like we're in a fairy world.",
        "And just like that, everything's back to normal. It's like magic!",
        "I hope a mermaid visits the beach.",
        "Bummer... Willy says we have to stay on the beach... And I brought my sword and everything...",
        "The beach is okay, but it gets boring pretty quick. I'd rather check out that dark jungle, or the volcano!",
        "Hmm, you think I could sneak my guinea pig onto the island? Nah, David's probably not much of a swimmer anyways.",
        "My skin gets burnt really easily. So I'm just gonna stay under this umbrella for a while. I like it in the shade. Too much sun makes me dizzy.",
        "Hey [Player], want to build a sand castle with me? Actually, a sand dungeon might be cooler!",
        "Hey [Player], you think you could build a raft? I saw a few cool islands on the way here I want to visit.",
        "An island this big has got to be hiding some buried treasure. Quick, get me a shovel! Relax, I'm just kidding.",
        "Gus made me a dark purple refresher, to match my hair. It tastes great!",
        "I'm gonna ask Willy if we can take the scenic route back.",
        "Maybe we'll see a sea monster on the way back.",
        "Hi. Do you feel like everything seems unreal lately? Not in a bad way, though.",
        "I usually feel lonely this time of year, but not anymore. [Player], what are your plans for the future?",
        "[Player], there's something I want to tell you...It's just... um... well... your boots! They, uh...look really clean... *gulp*That's all... *sigh*",
        "Another year is almost over... But this was a really good year, don't you think?",
        "Wow, you look nice today. I mean, that summer air is really good for the complexion, isn't it?... heh...",
        "Do you ever get lonely on your farm?",
        "I had an interesting dream last night, with you in it. It was a good dream.",
        "Uh... <player>? We've been dating for almost a year. Is this going anywhere?",
        "Hehe. Me? Married? I never thought this would happen. We're going to have a lot of fun together.",
        "I'm engaged to a farmer. Wow! Our lives are going to be a lot different from now on.",
        "I heard you and Sebastian started dating... I didn't realize you guys had a thing...",
        "Congratulations on the marriage. I guess that means Sebastian won't be moving to the city like he always talked about.",
        "That'll be nice. I'd be kind of sad if I never saw him again. We've always been good friends.",
        "Don't talk to me!",
        "*sigh*... I can't stay mad at you anymore, [Player]. Let's just move on with our lives.",
        "Searching for eggs is like going on a Treasure Hunt!",
        "Do you think I'm too old to do the egg hunt?",
        "Go away! We're adversaries until the egg hunt is over!",
        "I'm still mad that you beat me at the egg hunt last year. You'd better start practicing..",
        "I'm definitely going to enter the egg hunt tomorrow. Are you?",
        "Hey, the egg festival is tomorrow. I'm sorry, but I won't go easy on you because we're married! I plan on winning that egg hunt. Go ahead and try to beat me.",
        "Feeling pretty good about the egg hunt, huh? Well, next year you won't be so lucky...",
        "I'm glad you fixed up the bus, this is really fun!I've always wanted to travel beyond Pelican Town.",
        "I really hate dancing in front of everyone... It's so embarrassing. Mom makes me do it.",
        "They should make the seniors dance this year. I bet they'd love it!",
        "That's flattering... but I'm gonna have to say no. Sorry.",
        "Hey, sure. Let's do it. We can be embarrassed together.",
        "But... But I wanted to dance with... Just kidding! Of course I'm dancing with you. I love you.",
        "Well, tomorrow is the flower dance. Dancing is alright, but they make me wear this stupid white dress...",
        "I hope you've been practicing your moves...Tomorrow is the flower dance!",
        "It's tiring to socialize with everyone... I'd rather watch the sea.",
        "Don't let me stop you from having fun today. I just feel like watching the sea by myself.",
        "Everyone's excited for the Luau tomorrow. Maybe a little nervous, too, considering the Governor will be here.",
        "Such a rare and exciting thing...",
        "You can't miss tomorrow's festival. It's one of the most beautiful wonders of the valley.",
        "Should we go to the Spirit's Eve festival tomorrow night?",
        "I beat all the games... now what?",
        "I beat all these games last year!",
        "What do you think of my snow-goon?",
        "Hey, honey... look, it's you!",
        "I'm looking forward to making a snow man tomorrow.",
        "This is so mysterious... I love it!",
        "Nothing like a piping hot feast on a cold winter's day, huh?",
        "I wonder if I could lick one of those canes...",
        "I'm going to eat so much cranberry sauce tomorrow.",
        "The wedding was wonderful... wasn't it, dear? Well, we can't forget about the farm... time to get to work.",
        "I always loved this place, long before you moved in. Now I can explore the farm whenever I want!",
        "Heading to the mines? Hey... if you find something tasty, remember to bring me a piece!",
        "Hey! I'm just debating what I should do today. I'm not used to having this much freedom!",
        "You don't mind if I do some re-decorating now and then, do you? I'm still excited to have a place of my own to work on.",
        "There's always something new happening on our farm... I love it.",
        "Hey, [Player]. Heading out into the wild? I got you something... Use that if you get into a tough spot. It should help keep you safe.",
        "I got up a little before you and fed David Jr. He's very active this morning. I hope you don't mind the guinea pig smell.",
        "The soft breeze is blowing mountain air throughout the valley today. It smells like fresh pine and sage.",
        "Hmm... I think we've got plenty of space for outdoor slime ranching!",
        "Make sure to keep things tidy around your Grandpa's shrine. There's something special about it, I can feel it.",
        "It's pretty cool that we have a cave on our property. It's something I always dreamed about.",
        "I always forget to put some snacks in my pocket. *rumble*",
        "I'm just going to hang out here, okay? There's a lot of interesting bugs and things out here. *chuckle*",
        "*Abigail is lost in her music*",
        "I got up early and fed all the farm animals. I hope that makes your job a little easier, I also filled <pet name>'s water bowl.",
        "I had a good day, today. There's always something interesting going on around here, if you look close enough.",
        "Hey! Tell me about your day. Did anything exciting happen?",
        "I used to be a night owl, but I'm starting to enjoy the rhythm of life on the farm. It feels natural.",
        "*yawn*... I'm ready to call it a night pretty soon.",
        "The sounds of the night are louder out here. I'll never stop enjoying that.",
        "Are you ready for bed soon? I turned on the electric blanket for us...",
        "The dark... the rain... it gets me excited.",
        "Hey, remember when we played that duet by the lake? This weather reminds me of that day. You really surprised me with that mini-harp... I never expected that. I guess that's why I like you so much.",
        "It might be a good day to visit the caves, huh? Just be careful out there. If you go, bring a Life Elixir or two.",
        "Maybe I'll boot up Journey Of The Prairie King today... one of these days I swear I'll beat it on my own.",
        "The countryside looks more interesting on a day like this, don't you think?",
        "Hey! I woke up early and did some exploring on my own. I found this and it reminded me of you. Think you can find something better than that? I'm not so sure!",
        "I was just gazing out into the rainswept woods... I swear I saw something darker than black shifting around the trees.",
        "It's a good night to see a ghost...",
        "Can you feel it? There's a stillness in the rain...",
        "On nights like this, I like to turn the light down low and just listen...",
        "Hey! You look like you've been hard at work. Can I help you relax?",
        "Have you been working hard? You look cute when you're a little exhausted.",
        "The sound of rain should put us right to sleep tonight.",
        "I'm ready to hop into bed whenever you are. The sound of rain will put us right to sleep.",
        "I felt like making some soup for dinner. I hope it's not too disgusting.",
        "I'm going in to town today, just so you know. I need to stretch these legs a bit.",
        "Hey! Did you have a good day? Mine went well. It was refreshing to take a walk.",
        "Hun/Sweetie, I'm pregnant. Isn't it wonderful?",
        "I can't believe I'm a \"mom\"... life is weird.",
        "Everything went well, and now little <child name> is part of the family. We're very fortunate.",
        "I wonder if <child name> will grow up to be a farmer like you?",
        "Don't worry, I'll feed <child name> today. You can just focus on running the farm.",
        "I already gave [child] and [child] their chocolate cereal. They were screaming!",
        "I had a dream that [child] will grow up to be a famous monster hunter. I've already been thinking about a little armor set.",
        "A cool old house, a couple kids, and an amazing farm. I never thought I'd come this far... but, hey! Our lives are just getting started.",
        "Did you hear that? Sometimes I'm convinced this house is haunted.",
        "Welwick's horoscope predicted great things for me today. I feel really motivated!",
        "I can't even remember the last time I dyed my hair... I swear, it never fades from this color...",
        "I'm glad I owned a heavy pair of boots before moving in. It's hard to imagine tip-toeing around the mud in sneakers.",
        "I was just admiring the mermaid's pendant you gave me... I'll proudly wear this to my grave.",
        "Hey. I know you're smart, but I still worry about you sometimes. The world is full of monsters. Just promise me you'll be careful. I don't want to lose you.",
        "[Player]? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for us. I'm really proud of you.",
        "I hope you'll still like me when I'm old and shriveled. It's going to happen some day!",
        "Do you think your Grandpa would be proud of us?",
        "I wonder how the old shop is doing? I should visit my parents again soon.",
        "If you moved on to the spirit world, I'd set up a little shrine for you next to Grandpa's.",
        "No matter how much we clean, the house keeps getting dirty again. I guess farms are kind of dirty.",
        "I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives? I might get bored.",
        "I used to be special to you, your best friend... now you only seem to put up with me when I make a hot dinner.",
        "You've been so cold to me lately... What's wrong with you? You're acting like a bog spirit...",
        "I wonder if I could've done better... I was very good friends with Sebastian before we met. He was probably the one...",
        "I may like the colder seasons, but by the end I'm always glad to see spring arrive.",
        "So, do you have any big plans for the new year?",
        "Do you have any new year's resolutions? I'm trying to lose a few pounds around the middle",
        "Oh man... I could go for some chocolate cake.",
        "I get sunburnt very easily, so I need to be careful this time of year. I hope you like me pale!",
        "Make sure you don't get a heat stroke, my love. Drink plenty of water and don't overwork yourself.",
        "Sorry about the smell... I was sweating all night in the heat.",
        "It's summer... that means the house is full of flies. Don't worry, I'll take care of them. It's fun!",
        "Do I smell pumpkin on you? Maybe I'm just dreaming...",
        "The scent is unmistakable... mushroom, rotting leaves, pumpkin. It's fall, alright. Isn't it lovely?",
        "Can we grow giant pumpkins this season? Please, honey?",
        "Ah... fall. This might be my favorite time of year. The colors really complement my hair, don't you think?",
        "Honey... you're worth more to me than a chest full of quartz. Now, a chest full of amethyst? Hmm... I'd have to think about that one.",
        "Brr... It's so cold, I guess it's winter already.",
        "Remember when we played 'Prairie King' together in my room, so long ago? Those were good times.",
        "I actually like the cold weather. It just gives me an excuse to get cozy!",
        "It's fun to explore the valley in winter! Everything is so different under a blanket of snow. And so quiet...",
        "Standing here, looking out on the horizon... I get a feeling of endless possibility. I'm just happy I get to explore this world, with you by my side...",
        "What are you doing here? Just leave me alone!",
        "(Name), What do you think happens to us after we die?",
        "Do you think I'm too old to do the egg hunt?",
        "Okay... pretend you just won a free vacation. Where would you go?",
        "I was thinking about dyeing my hair again... what do you think?",
        "I made these two drawings. What do you think?"

        "Wow, it's beautiful! This color makes me think of all the spiritual power within the forest... Can you feel that wood energy?",

        "Ooh!... I can read it on your face. You're going to love it here in Pelican Town. If you're ever looking for something to do in the evening, stop by the saloon. That's where I work!",
        "Have I told you Haley and I are sisters? Strange, isn't it?",
        "I have a secret hobby, but I won't say any more. Maybe I'll show you some day.",
        "This world is full of spirits and magic... Some don't believe me, but I know it's true. I can see it in your eyes... you believe in the other world, like me.",
        "I wish Haley would get a job or at least contribute to cooking and cleaning. I think she's hoping to marry someone rich.",
        "I work part-time at Gus' saloon. It pays the bills.",
        "I'm just working at Gus' to make ends meet... but my real passion is tailoring. I made these clothes from scratch, see?",
        "I've heard rumors of rare and powerful magic rings, forged long ago by forgotten civilizations. I'm not sure if it's true or just a fairy tale.",
        "You catch fish? I just hope you treat the poor things humanely. Every critter deserves our respect, even the slimy ones.",
        "I hope you're farming in a sustainable way. The valley's ecosystem is fragile! How do I know? I have a strong gut-feeling!",
        "Sometimes the flowers speak to me... each one has a different story to tell!",
        "Ah, spring. The season of pastels. I actually prefer jewel tones, myself. Oh, excuse me! I was mumbling about fashion again, wasn't I?",
        "I like making my own clothes, but it's not easy to get cloth. And it's such a long trip to the city.",
        "Hi [Player]! Do you raise sheep in your barn? You can turn their wool into beautiful bolts of cloth! You'll need a loom, though. You can make them yourself if you know the crafting recipe.",
        "This house was left in our care by my parents. They've been traveling the world for the last two years. We have no idea when they'll be back. I enjoy living here, though. It's a beautiful area and the town is nice.",
        "Oh, hi... It's nice of you to visit me like this.",
        "Have faith... every day you're taking one more step on the path of your destiny.",
        "Do you ever think about the texture of fabric, [Player]? Each texture has a distinct personality... feel my dress... see?",
        "I have to say, now that Haley's gone I've had a much easier time keeping things in order.",
        "There's good people in this town who just can't seem to find happiness. It makes me sad. Working in the saloon, I hear first-hand about everyone's problems.",
        "You know, [Player]... I think the future looks bright for both of us.",
        "Hi, [Player]. I always knew we'd become close like this...",
        "Doctor, I'd like to go with the 'natural remedy' if possible.",
        "Haley is a picky eater. It's so hard to cook for her.",
        "Eating healthy is very important to me. I want to live a long and active life.",
        "Hello there, [Player]. I feel lazy today.",
        "I feel bad for Linus. People judge him, but he's just living a different lifestyle. I wish everyone could learn to be accepting of others.",
        "It doesn't rain much in summer, does it? That just means more watering work for you, huh? Or do you enjoy the sunny weather?",
        "I consider the bees and butterflies to be my special friends!",
        "If I wasn't so busy I'd come help you on the farm! But Gus would be upset if I had another job...",
        "Don't overwork yourself or you might end up in Harvey's clinic!",
        "It's around this time of year that my good friends visit the region... I mean the parrots!",
        "Hi, [Player]! We've become decent friends, haven't we? That's fine with me. [You're a cool guy. / I'm glad.]",
        "You know, I'm sure Gus would understand if I wanted to leave the Saloon someday. There's so much out there, I can't stay a barmaid forever.",
        "Haley and I get along much better now that she's moved out. I look forward to her visits!",
        "Hi, [Player]! We've become decent friends, haven't we? This may sound weird, but I've always been certain this would happen.",
        "Well, fall is here. Time to plant some new crops, huh?",
        "It's good weather for a picnic, isn't it?",
        "Hello. Did you have a good summer?",
        "Hi [Player]! I bet your farm did great this past summer, huh? You're an excellent farmer.",
        "My friend runs a shop in the desert. If you ever go there stop in and say hi for me. I think she sells some rare products.",
        "Are you friends with Clint? He's a nice guy, if you get to know him. He gets lonely working in his shop all day. But he's so shy he has trouble making new friends.",
        "Another beautiful fall day. It's a pity it'll soon be over.",
        "Keep your mind open and some interesting things might take root. Anyway, how is your day going?",
        "Nothing like a sunny Sunday to lift the spirits!",
        "Smell that clean air? It's lovely, isn't it? I just fear that the Joja Co.'s of the world will take this away from us",
        "I don't have any huge plans for life. I prefer not to stress about the future.",
        "There's so many invisible barriers holding us back. Why can't people learn to let go and celebrate freedom? Me? Well, you know what they say... 'You can't cage a wild Junimo'",
        "If I didn't have to work I'd suggest we go on a nice picnic!",
        "I think Clint's mad at me. He never looks at me anymore... I always thought we were friends.",
        "Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head!",
        "Oh, hello [Player]! You must be getting very good at farming by now, huh?",
        "I bet you're an excellent farmer by now!",
        "I think my hair is frozen solid...",
        "Haley and I aren't made for such a big house. It's a hassle to keep it clean. Ah well. I really shouldn't be complaining. Your farmhouse seems nice and cozy.",
        "It must be so cold for the poor fish. I wonder if any fish hibernate? Maybe I should ask Demetrius.",
        "If I wasn't so busy I'd help you dig around in that cave by the lake. I bet there are some powerful crystals inside there.",
        "Do you know how to cook 'Bean Hotpot'? I like that dish quite a bit. It's hard to get fresh ingredients in the winter, huh?",
        "My sister and I might fight sometimes, but I would really miss her if she left. I think she'll become a very nice young lady some day... Don't tell her I said that. So, is there anything you want to talk about?",
        "Say hi to my sister for me. And remind her to visit me tomorrow.",
        "There must be a meaning behind this... Nature is trying to tell us something. What, though? I can't tell... It's hard to read. I feel a strong presence, though...",
        "Can you feel it? The forest is singing! The trees are dancing with joy!",
        "Oh, I like this place! It's full of parrots!",
        "If you open your heart to the sun, you can feel a loving energy inside of you.",
        "Can you feel it? The ocean has a profound healing energy.",
        "Are you having fun, [Player]? You need to remember to take breaks now and then too!",
        "It's nice to be on this side of the bar for once!",
        "Ah... my lungs feel perfect.",
        "Yoba, please protect me from the dark energy of this movie.",
        "You're such a nice person, [Player]! Thanks for being my friend.",
        "Be careful an icicle doesn't fall on your head! I wouldn't want you to get hurt!",
        "...!!! I accept!! ... I'll set everything up. We'll have the ceremony in 3 days, okay?",
        "Can you believe we're about to move in together? I've never lived with anyone but my family. It's... exciting.",
        "I always knew something important would happen between us... I just never thought it would be this! The parrot is excited too.",
        "\"B...But I thought we had a special bond... *sniff*\"",
        "...",
        "[Player]... I'm ready to give you a second chance. I still have faith that there's a good person inside of you.",
        "I've been up since dawn coloring eggs... it's always my favorite part of the season.",
        "Ah, it feels good here in the shade.",
        "Hmm...I'm sensing that your fashion doesn't quite match your inner feeling. Just step in the box and we'll fix you up!",
        "Okay, before we continue, let me visualize your aura, to see what kind of style will make you happiest...Okay, I've got it! I'm coming in, so don't be alarmed!Yes! I can feel it, your inner self and outer self are now in perfect alignment! I can't wait for you to see the new 'you'!",
        "You're looking great! Come back another day and we'll put together a fresh new look for you!",
        "Whoo... I'm stuffed. Hey, have you tried the red jelly yet?",
        "Oh, hey! This year I'm giving my sister competition for the flower queen title.",
        "Yes, I'd love to dance with you, [Player]!",
        "Now I'm excited... This is going to be a lot of fun!",
        "I'm very sorry... but I've already agreed to dance with someone else.",
        "Look out there, at the endless sea. Deep underwater, all kinds of life forms are moving around in the dark. Eerie, isn't it?",
        "You know, I would've made a good clown. I think I missed my calling.",
        "Do you like the jack-o-lanterns? I carved them myself.",
        "Wow, this snowman needs a makeover. Who made this?",
        "I think this boat's my favorite. It's so unique!",
        "[Player]! What are you hoping to find under the spirit tree?",
        "Another beautiful day on [farm name] farm... I have faith that something good will happen today!",
        "Hey, someone must've gotten a good night of sleep... you look fresh this morning.",
        "My horoscope for the day isn't too good... but I'm going to make the best of it, as always. Let's get to work!",
        "Ughh... *gurgle*... I ate too many bran muffins for breakfast.",
        "By providing fresh, healthy produce to the community, we're doing a great service!",
        "I'm going to spend some time with the parrot today. It breaks my heart that he'll never fly again.",
        "Here, take this. It's for you.",
        "I love getting up early. There's a certain freshness to the air and the wildlife is much more active.",
        "What's on the agenda today, dear?",
        "Oooh! Ooh! I saw another one! I'm counting squirrels.",
        "A little sunlight is good for you. Just don't get crispy, okay?",
        "Good morning! I was wondering when you'd finally roll out of bed! It's okay, [Player]... you deserve a good night of rest.",
        "You're doing great work, [Player]. Keep it up.",
        "This is my favorite spot for a morning meditation. I visualize the energy from this crystal garden flowing through my body.",
        "Is that a new hole I see in your shirt? I can sew that up for you, no problem.",
        "Welcome home, [Player]. I hope you had a wonderful day.",
        "Is it bed time already? My, the day just floated away from me again.",
        "Ah, that aroma! It can only be you. It's a good smell.",
        "I swept the whole house, washed the windows, dusted, and cleaned the fridge. It was a very productive day!",
        "It's a very cozy house... I like it.",
        "I wonder where the flying insects go when it rains? Don't they get hit by the raindrops?",
        "A day like this is a blessing from mother nature.",
        "I meant to let the parrot go free, but his wing never fully healed. He seems content, though. I give him lots of attention. He told me that he's happy here.",
        "I never told you this... but when you first moved here I had a dream about you. I knew right then that our life-paths would intertwine.",
        "I know you pride yourself on your work, but don't overdo it today. Okay, honey?",
        "Good morning... I got this gift for you. Don't worry, I already purified it with sage incense.",
        "Every moment has a unique and precious beauty... do you notice? It can be easy to forget, sometimes.",
        "I can hear the plants talking to each other... they're so happy after today's rain!",
        "How was your day, [Player]? You look a little soggy.",
        "My day was very peaceful. How was yours?",
        "Does the sound of rain ever put you in a trance?",
        "Certain spirits only appear in the rain. Maybe you've heard their cries?",
        "Want some dessert? It's my special raw, gluten-free version, sweetened only with cactus syrup.",
        "I'm going to visit town today, and later on I'm going to help out at the saloon. Have a nice day.",
        "Gus seems to have problems organizing everything without me around.",
        "My day went well... it's good to get out of the house now and then.",
        "I hope we can raise [child] to be kind and considerate. That's more important than getting A's in school.",
        "Is one child enough, or should we raise another? I guess we'll just see where fate leads us.",
        "I lit a pale green candle and shook a sprig of baby-mint over [child]. That should ward off any dangerous spirits",
        "A big house, two kids and a parrot... I have my hands full!",
        "Well, [child] certainly has your hair...",
        "Oh, I already fed the kids their organic quinoa puffs with goat milk. You just focus on the farm!",
        "This is so fun to live together! I always thought I'd be single my whole life.",
        "It was our destiny to be together... I believe that with all my heart!",
        "Thanks for taking me into your home. I love this new life.",
        "Our vibrational energies are perfectly in tune. Can't you feel it?",
        "I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is beautiful! I can feel the pure blue energy radiating from it.",
        "I had another dream about us last night. We had climbed to the top of a crystal tree, looking down on the most lush and beautiful meadow. I keep having this dream. I don't know what it means, but I feel that it's a good omen.",
        "I hope you'll still like me when I grow old and my hair turns to a dull, faded steel.",
        "I feel uninspired today.",
        "Happy new year, honey. Let's make this a special one.",
        "My friends, the plants, have come back to life. I feel content.",
        "Hmm... I'm thinking maybe a salad of fresh foraged greens for dinner tonight?",
        "Phew! It's hot but it feels great, doesn't it? Maybe we'll see some wild parrots today.",
        "May Yoba bless you on this lovely day.",
        "The energy in our bodies fluctuate just as the seasons do. Understanding your own unique rhythm is the first step to inner harmony.",
        "I drank a super-food smoothie this morning and I feel aaah-mazing!",
        "The year's already half-way over. Can you believe it?",
        "Have you figured out what you're going to use for our grange display tomorrow?",
        "Our bodies are naturally in tune with the seasons. This light and color of fall compels us to prepare for the barren winter. To our distant ancestors, this feeling was encompassing and vital. For us, it only barely peeks through the noise of modern life.",
        "Whoops, my hair is frozen solid again.",
        "I can't help but think of all the poor, frozen squirrels out there right now.",
        "*sigh*... Why does there have to be war and hatred in the world?",
        "On a day like this, I have a craving for cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and cardamom.",
        "Thanks for a great year, [Player]. I'm excited to tackle next year together.",
        "This is a special moment... I've always known I would be standing here with you, someday. I've always felt it in my heart. Now, it's all come true. The world is a mysterious and special place...",
        "[Player], you broke my heart... I just can't talk to you anymore...Please, let me try to heal..."

    "Haley": [
        "Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons.  But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?",
        "*gasp*... You got this for me? Wow, <player>, this is the best birthday gift ever!",
        "Awwwww, you got me a birthday gift? Well, I really like it!",
        "For my birthday? Thanks.",
        "Gross! You got me this on my birthday? What's wrong with you!",
        "Oh my god, this is my favorite thing!",
        " Is that... coconut? I love this!Mmm.... coconuts remind me of warm, sunny days at the beach. When I hold one, I feel like I'm there... even when it's raining.",
        " For me? Ooooh... I can't decide if I should drink it, or use it as shampoo...",
        " Wow, they're beautiful! These are my absolute favorite.",
        "*gasp*...for me? Thank you!",
        "Thank you. I love presents.",
        "Ugh...that's such a stupid gift.",
        "Gross!",
        "[Player],I thought it would be fun to write you a note.I had so much fun with the cows yesterday... I'mstarting to understand why you chose the farmer'slife! Hope to see you soon.-Haley",
        "Oh... you're that new farmer [boy/girl], aren't you? Huh? Oh... I'm Haley. Hmm... If it weren't for those horrendous clothes you might actually be [cute/pretty]. Actually, nevermind.",
        "This town is so small. It sucks. I have to drive, like, twenty miles to buy any decent clothes. That's why I usually just order online. What?",
        "The only thing I like about this town is the beach.",
        "*sigh* I could really go for a cupcake right now. Do you need something?",
        "I've decided I am going to organise my clothes today. I'll have to throw out all of last year's styles to make room for the new ones!",
        "Don't you get tired of running around on that farm all day, or whatever it is you do? I couldn't stand getting all dirty like that. You probably get a nice tan, though.",
        "I'm feeling an urge to go shopping. Ugh! I wish there was a mall here.",
        "My sister is so weird. Sometimes I wonder if we're actually related.",
        "Did you know that my sister hates [item]? She finds it absolutely revolting. I guess everyone has their hang-ups.",
        "Nice makeup. Wait... Are you even wearing any? I'm bored.",
        "Nice shoes. Are those made out of plastic? I'm bored.",
        "Emily tried to serve me [adjective] [item] for dinner last night... I threw it away when she wasn't looking. I don't like health food...",
        "I spent all morning doing my hair... now the rain could mess it up. *sigh* ... Life is hard sometimes.",
        "I need a new hobby other than shopping. I've decided to expand my horizons. Maybe I should learn to play the mini-harp?",
        "I used to complain about this town being so small, but I've grown to like it. If it was much bigger it wouldn't feel like a community.",
        "I cooked dinner last night. It actually turned out okay! But I did make a huge mess in the kitchen...",
        "I'm thinking about donating a bunch of clothes... I must have a hundred pairs of shoes.",
        "There are only two things I like about this town. One of them is the beach. The other one is a secret! *giggle*",
        "Yesterday I found a seagull with her wing caught in a net. I set her free, of course. She looked so helpless, the poor thing.",
        "You know, I should probably start exercising more... this youthful metabolism won't last forever.",
        "I wonder if any nice shells washed up on the beach this morning? This isn't the best time of year for shells, though.",
        "I'm glad that the flowers are starting to bloom. Those pink ones smell so good.",
        "I'm going to get such a nice tan this summer.",
        "Ew, you're all dirty.",
        "Um... Yes? I didn't hear you, I'm thinking about something else.",
        "If you stay in the sun a lot it'll make your hair lighter. It's a good thing to know!",
        "I wonder what Alex is doing today... Huh? I didn't notice you standing there.",
        "Emily usually cooks dinner... But she makes weird stuff like quinoa.",
        "Do you wear those clothes every day?",
        "There's not a cloud in the sky today.",
        "It's so hot today! I wish I had some ice cream.",
        "I spent 3 hours practicing my signature today. I guess that's pretty silly, huh?",
        "If you stay in the sun a lot it will make your hair lighter... But you don't want to get sunburnt, either. I just want a healthy amount of sunlight. Everything in moderation, right?",
        "I should start reading some books instead of magazines. It's good to learn things, isn't it? I only ever look at the pictures.",
        "I talked to my sister for a while last night. I actually enjoyed it quite a bit. You know, Emily's not actually that weird. I guess we have more in common than I used to think. Don't tell her I said so.",
        "It's a nice day to go swimming.",
        "I guess living in the country isn't so bad. If I lived in the city I might start to miss all the trees. [Player], I think I've been hanging out with you too much.",
        "Hey I found this new tool to open jars with. So you won't need to help me anymore.",
        "It's fall already?",
        "It's gross when all these fallen leaves get slimy.",
        "Hmm... Something smells weird... You've been working on the farm, huh?",
        "Oh, hi. Did you want something?",
        "I feel the urge to go shopping. *sigh*",
        "Is that a grass stain on your knee? Sorry, I'm allergic to grass.",
        "I've never been to the forest. It's muddy and I could get a blister on my foot.",
        "Something smells earthy... Oh, right. You work on a farm.",
        "You look like you've been doing a lot of hard work. Why don't you take the rest of the day off?",
        "If you're ever bored, come say hi.",
        "Shopping just doesn't sound as fun as it used to. What's happening to me? Hmm...",
        "See this bracelet? It belonged to my great-grandmother. She was a really interesting lady.",
        "I've never been to the forest, you know. It might be interesting to explore it some day.",
        "Did I ever tell you I found another one of my great-grandma's bracelets in the attic? She was a really interesting lady.",
        "I'm starting to like the smell of dirt. Isn't that weird? I think it's because you're around all the time.",
        "I want to move somewhere warmer.",
        "It's too cold to get out of bed.",
        "Hi. Do you need something from me?",
        "Hmm. What brand is your shirt? Oh. Um, nevermind.",
        "I wish someone would bring me a peppermint coffee. Don't even bother, I know you won't be able to make one.",
        "I'm going to start writing a list of all the clothes I need for next spring.",
        "Do you have a pony on your farm? Oh. That's disappointing...",
        "The only good thing about winter is that I get to sleep more. I like at least 10 hours of sleep every night.",
        "Will you say hi to Alex for me? Thanks.",
        "Your name is [Player], right? I keep forgetting.",
        "Hi [Player]. Is anything exciting happening on your farm?",
        "I think I'm starting to realize that clothes aren't the most important thing. Right?I still like clothes, though. I mean, what's wrong with expressing yourself a little?",
        "Maybe I'll donate some of my skirts to a charity this spring.I mean, I do have over 1,000 skirts....what?",
        "Um, if you see Alex could you tell him I'm busy today? Thanks.",
        "I wish it were warmer here in Stardew Valley. I could move somewhere else, but...",
        "Do you think you'll ever have a pony on your farm?",
        "I'm glad you have less work to do in the winter. It must be nice to have a break, huh",
        "The weather's too horrible to get out of bed.",
        "I don't think I've ever set foot in this place. It's actually kind of cozy! Oh, I'm not worried about the rain. I'm sure it'll pass.",
        "Wake me up when there's a pink rain... Or better yet, a pink cake rain!",
        "It's nothing serious... I'm just here for my annual check-up.",
        "Well... my nose has been a little runny, Doctor. But otherwise I'm doing fine!",
        "I saw a dolphin on the way in!",
        "This is such a perfect beach. I'd stay here forever if I could!",
        "It's strange the places life can take you... who knows what other lands are out there?",
        "Wow, look at how the sunlight sparkles on the horizon! I bet the sunsets here would make for an amazing photo. I have to remember to bring my camera next time.",
        "Getting the perfect tan is an artform... It's kind of like toasting a marshmallow... you have to rotate the body just right.",
        "Laying out on a tropical beach. *sigh* I think I've finally found my place in the universe. But I guess Stardew Valley's not such a bad place either!",
        "Emily's friend had this swimsuit shipped to me from all the way out in Zuzu City. City fashion is on a whole different level, isn't it?",
        "I painted my toenails blue to match the sea. What do you think? *wiggle* *wiggle*",
        "Gus made a cute, fruity drink just for me!",
        "There's something about the sun that just makes me feel good.",
        "[Player], can we go on a camping trip someday? The most exotic place I've been is Zuzu city.",
        "Do you have baby bunnies on your farm? Bunnies are SO cute!",
        "Oh, hi [Player]! Do you like kids?",
        "[Player], I'm happy to see you today.",
        "[Player], you look [rugged/pretty] today. I like it.",
        "So, what's the idea here... am I just going to be your 'girlfriend' forever...?",
        "I'm so happy! It's just like I always dreamed.",
        "It's okay. I know we can't have a honeymoon, since your farm needs to be taken care of. I'm a farmer now, too!",
        "I've got nothing to say to you!",
        "Alright, alright... I'm done giving you the cold shoulder. Just promise me you'll never, ever lie to me again.",
        "This festival is alright... but what I'm really looking forward to is the Flower Dance.",
        "Oh! I still need to get my photo taken at the bunny stand. Does my hair look okay?",
        "I was going to eat some eggs, but then I remembered I'm on a spring diet.",
        "If you smell something good, it's the coconut oil I rubbed all over my skin. I'm going 'all in' with the desert feeling!",
        "I'm practicing my dance moves... It needs to be perfect. I've been flower queen for the past 5 years and I'm not ready to step off the throne just yet!",
        "One, two, three... one, two, three... Oh, hi. I'm a little busy",
        "Oh... you want to dance with *me* do you?",
        "Hehe... of course. I'd love to be your partner.",
        "Hmm... I admire your confidence. Most guys are too shy to ask me.",
        "Oh! Sure! I'll dance with you!",
        "We'll have a great time!",
        "You look so pretty today!",
        "Ew... No.",
        "I would dance, but I don't want to get sweaty.",
        "Phew... I'm afraid to move, or else I might start to sweat.",
        "I should've brought my camera! I always forget.",
        "Have you been to the fortune teller? She set up her stand in the graveyard.I already saw her... she told me something.., interesting. *giggle*",
        "Did you remember to bring good stuff for our grange display? I hope we win this year",
        "Eek! I'm too scared.",
        "I get scared easily... I think I'm just going to stay right here.",
        "I guess Winter isn't all bad... playing in the snow can be fun!",
        "Brr... my hands are freezing from making this snowman.",
        "Brrr.... I'm not dressed for this...",
        "I hope there's a new camera for me under the spirit tree!",
        "It's so pretty... I wish our town could always look like this!",
        "Me?... Oh, I'm thankful for... how about I just show you when we get home tonight?",
        "Good morning! Did you sleep well? I think I might break out the old camera today... the lighting is just perfect.",
        "Good morning, dear! Smells good, doesn't it? I made you breakfast! I know you're busy with your work. I'm here to support you in any way I can!",
        "Did you sleep okay? You were snoring a little. I've got some chores to do in here. Have a good day.",
        "I'm glad I've learned to enjoy cleaning! The house gets dirty very easily. It's satisfying to get everything squeaky clean. Can I have a kiss before you leave?",
        "Good morning, dear. Another day of farm chores, huh? I'll be thinking of you.",
        "I felt like I had no direction in life before I met you. Now I have exactly what I want.",
        "This place is my home now... I'm happy here.",
        "Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry about you falling into a mine shaft.",
        "I always feel best when I'm outside, breathing fresh air... Don't get me wrong, your grandpa's old cottage is very nice! But nothing beats this beautiful landscape.",
        "We've got to make sure the farm is cute! That might be important... right, honey?",
        "Hi, honey! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry! I'll be thinking of you.",
        "I'm just going to do some dusting over here. That should help you out, right? *phew*... it's hot out here.",
        "Don't overwork yourself, dear. Make sure and take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.",
        "Looks like a good day to work on my tan, don't you think, sweetheart?",
        "Say 'goat cheese'!",
        "You look like you've been working hard, dear. Let me help you de-stress.",
        "Wow, you look like you did a lot of work today. Now you should just kick back and relax for the night.",
        "*phew* I just finished my chores. Now we can spend some time together. So, tell me about your day. ...",
        "Did you get everything done today, [Player]? I did some house chores... but now I'm so tired.",
        "Are you done with your work for the day? I'm ready to have some fun. But if you're tired I understand.",
        "I've changed a lot over the years, but I still prefer sunny weather.",
        "Sometimes I daydream about our retirement... relaxing on the sunny beaches of the Fern Islands! Do you ever think about the future, [Player]?",
        "I can't go outside today... my hair will go limp. Forgive me, dear. I want to look my best for you.",
        "Are you going out in this weather? Just make sure to wipe your boots on the way back in, honey. I'll just stay here and do some housework.",
        "Oh no... If this weather keeps up I'll get so pale!",
        "Good morning! I got up early and baked something sweet for you! I know you're strong, but you still need to eat well to stay at your best!",
        "Oh, I'm glad you're back. It's so cold in here by myself... Are you almost ready to shut off the lights?",
        "I hope it's nice and sunny tomorrow morning. Too much rain can make me moody.",
        "Rain is horrible for a photographer. The lighting is awful, and you can't go outside without ruining your equipment!",
        "I hope Emily isn't too lonely all by herself. I should visit her again soon.",
        "I never thought I'd say this, but the country lifestyle really suits me.",
        "Hi, honey! I'm so glad you're home. I was starting to get kind of lonely.",
        "I made a hot meal for you, honey. Lots of spice, just how you like it. Enjoy!",
        "I'm going to socialize in town for a bit today.",
        "It was nice seeing everyone in town. Did you have a good day, dear?",
        "Hi, honey! I'm mostly just here to visit Emily.",
        "Isn't it strange? I'm not used to being a mother.",
        "Isn't [Second Child] a very good-looking baby?",
        "A big house, two kids, and a beautiful plot of land. I'm not sure what else I could ask for.",
        "Aren't you glad winter's over, honey? Things seem more hopeful now.",
        "Now that winter's over, we've got lots of sunny weather to look forward to. I'm excited.",
        "So, what are we planting this season?",
        "I was going to eat some eggs, but then I remembered I'm on a spring diet.",
        "*sigh*... My days of being Flower Queen are over... so it's a bittersweet dance for me. But, yes...",
        "I love watching the fireflies on a hot summer's night. It's the closest I'll ever come to visiting the stars.",
        "Sorry if I don't look my best... the air is just so humid that my hair doesn't hold up too well.",
        "Phew... I'm afraid to move, or else I might start to sweat.",
        "It's summer... that means the house is full of flies and ants... yuck.",
        "Even though I prefer summer, fall might be the best season to take pictures. Those long, low shadows...",
        "Fall is kind of sad for me... everything is dying.",
        "I already miss summer...",
        "Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house. Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.",
        "Have you figured out what you're going to use for our grange display tomorrow?",
        "Did you remember to bring good stuff for our grange display? I hope we win this year.",
        "Should we go to the Spirit's Eve festival tomorrow night?",
        "I get scared easily... I think I'm just going to stay right here.",
        "I was just thinking about the time you helped me open a jar of pickles. Remember that? We've come a long way since then.",
        "For some reason, the snowy weather gives me cravings for pink cake...",
        "Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?",
        "Brr... my hands are freezing from making this snowman.",
        "My skin feels so dry in this weather.",
        "Me?... Oh, I'm thankful for... how about I just show you when we get home tonight?",
        "Thanks for a great year, [Player]. I'm excited to tackle next year together.",
        "*giggle*... Oh, it's just that... As a little girl, I always dreamed that one day, I would climb to the summit with my true love, and share a kiss.",
        "I'll really be fine on my own... but thanks for the memories, [Player].Why are you still clinging to me? Go live your own life.",
        "Farming sounds sooo boring... What do you even do all day?",
        "It's too cold to go to the beach anymore. *sigh*...what do you think I should do today?"

    "Leah": [
        "Leah lives alone in a small cabin just outside of town. She loves to spend time outside, foraging for a wild meal or simply enjoying the gifts of the season. She's a talented artist with a large portfolio of work' yet she's too nervous to display it to the public. Maybe you can give her a little confidence boost?",
        "Hey, thanks a bunch, <player>! This makes my birthday feel special.",
        "Oh... It's for my birthday? ... Thanks.",
        "Oh! This is exactly what I wanted! Thank you!",
        " This looks delicious... Thank you! There's nothing quite like a fresh, wild salad.",
        " Oh, wow (Name)! This is exactly what I was craving! How'd you know?",
        " Oh, wow... I had a sip of this stuff when I was a kid, and I've never forgotten the taste.",
        " Hey, where'd you find that? *sniff*... Mmm... This will be perfect, grated over a fresh pasta! Thank you!",
        " Mmm... Back in the city, the veggies never tasted this fresh. I love it!",
        "This is a really nice gift! Thank you!",
        "Oh! Thank you! This one has an interesting shape...",
        "Thank you.",
        "Hmm... I guess everyone has different tastes.",
        "This is a pretty terrible gift, isn't it?",
        "Hello, it's nice to meet you.  You picked a good time to move here... The spring is lovely.",
        "Hi. Oh, you want to talk? The landscape around here gives me a lot of ideas. The terrain is almost like a sculpture itself.I don't make art for money. It's just an urge that I have.Farming seems like a very rewarding profession. You get to create delicious food for everyone! You're probably busy. Sorry.",
        "Hello, neighbor. We both live outside of town. Does that mean something?",
        "This morning I accidentally stepped on a bug. Sometimes I think it's impossible to live without destroying nature in some way.",
        "There's actually a lot of wild food in this area, if you know where to look. I've been having fresh salads almost every day.",
        "It's simpler to be friends with the trees. They don't have much to say.",
        "We wouldn't be able to survive without nature. It's good to remember that.",
        "Hello, [Player]. It's a nice day, isn't it? Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.",
        "I love to decorate for the different seasons.",
        "If you hear any banging from inside my hut, it's probably just me working on one of my sculptures.",
        "The other day I bought an [item] at Pierre's. It was perfect on a bed of greens and a dash of my 'special' vinaigrette.",
        "I love being around animals. They're so innocent. Farm animals are wonderful, too.",
        "Foraging is a specialty of mine. Someday I'll make you a fresh salad.",
        "Hi [Player]! I was just thinking about you and your farm. I was imagining how good it must feel to harvest a big bunch of crops. Wouldn't it be nice to have help, though?",
        "Farming sounds so fun. I want to try it, someday.",
        "If you ever find any interesting looking driftwood, I could use it. It would be special that you gave it to me.",
        "Do you ever wonder what it's like to be a different person?Do our thoughts manifest in a similar way, or is it radically different?Don't mind me, I think about weird things sometimes...",
        "It must be satisfying to harvest a whole field of crops, huh? You're basically creating food out of nothing!",
        "Maybe I should cook something new and exciting today. Something spicy.",
        "You can tell it's summer by the sweet smell of nectar wafting through the air!",
        "I found some wild fruits this morning! Sorry, I don't have any left. Keep looking, I'm sure you'll find something.",
        "The sound of farm animals is great, isn't it?",
        "The simple things in life are best: a soft summer breeze, majestic clouds, and a goblet full of Stardew Valley red.",
        "You can use a tapper to harvest syrups and other useful liquids directly from trees. It's a slow process, but the result can be quite valuable.",
        "I hate to be blunt, but if we don't treat nature with respect, our grandchildren will be doomed. Don't you think so?",
        "The flowing water keeps my house a little bit cooler in summer. I can't tolerate heat very well.",
        "What should I do on such a warm, lazy day? *sigh* Any ideas?",
        "I have a good eye for wild fruit. Some day I'll make you a nice fruit salad.",
        "Hello, [Player]. Do you ever get lonely on that big farm? Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.",
        "How quickly the seasons change! It's shocking.",
        "I found some wild mushrooms over the weekend! I had a huge plate of wild mushrooms and eggs for breakfast today... I'm still full. Keep your nose to the ground and you'll find some mushrooms yourself... I'm sure of it.",
        "I wonder if I could make a collage out of dried leaves? They're just so colorful... I can't help but think of the potential for art projects.",
        "Everyone has a unique and interesting perspective, whether they believe it or not. Don't you think so? Although, some people have opinions that I just can't respect.",
        "It's so nice to live by the river. I fall asleep to the soothing sound of water every night.",
        "Do you have a kitchen in your house? If you have a kitchen, you can cook all kinds of delicious meals.",
        "Decorations accentuate the feeling of the season. I think it's a worthwhile tradition.",
        "There's a lot of good places to walk around here. It feels good to stretch your legs.",
        "One of these days I'll have to make you a wild mushroom stir-fry.",
        "Stop by my cabin if you ever need someone to talk to.",
        "I love the way everything looks when it's covered with fresh snow.",
        "It gets pretty cold in my little cabin. I just snuggle up under a huge blanket, and I'm okay.",
        "I saw a snow rabbit early this morning! They're rare, aren't they?",
        "I'm having a hard time finding fresh food to eat. I've been eating a lot of bread.",
        "Time seems to move slower here. When I lived in the city, the year went by so fast.",
        "Hello. Do you want something?",
        "Hello, [Player]. Is there something you wanted to talk about?",
        "Do you ever take a whole day off? It's a refreshing break.",
        "*Sigh*... It's hard to get fresh food in the winter. I bet your farm is pretty well stocked with food, huh?",
        "Do you ever get cold in that farmhouse of yours? Stop by my cabin if you want to huddle under one of my quilts and drink cider.",
        "Where did all these plants come from? It's a surprise, but I'm not complaining...",
        "Imagine if this rain lasted all summer... The plants would take over the entire valley!",
        "I guess everyone in town was scared of that strange rain? I had no idea... I just thought it was incredible!",
        "Don't tell anyone, but Willy let me steer the boat for a few minutes.",
        "I love the weather in Stardew Valley, but seeing a different climate now and then helps put things into perspective.",
        "The shape of the waves here is awe inspiring. I wonder if I could ever capture that sort of formlessness in a sculpture.",
        "I like the heat as long as I'm keeping perfectly still.",
        "Mmm, I bet the trees around here would make for an interesting medium to work with. Though Willy probably wouldn't be happy with me if I dragged a bunch of logs onto his ship!",
        "I wonder what kind of things you could forage out here. I think I saw some tasty looking walnuts growing on a bush nearby.",
        "Have you tried the Pi\u00f1a Colada? I'm on my second one... hehe.",
        "Well, that was deeply relaxing.",
        "... I'm a little nervous. But happy.",
        "I've always dreamed of living on a farm. I'm going to be so happy.",
        "I don't want to see you for a while...",
        "You caused a lot of grief with what you did... but I'm ready to put the past behind us.",
        "Mmm, this fruit punch is unusually good!",
        "Hmm... The punch isn't as good as last year. It's missing something!",
        "I never had many friends in town, so these events are always kind of boring for me. I enjoy the buffet, though.",
        "I was just wondering...If I lived here, instead of Stardew Valley, would my art look different?",
        "Hi [Player]. Glad to see you here.",
        "I really feel connected with nature this far away from town.",
        "I'll be honest. I don't want to dance with you.",
        "How's the farming coming along? It must be a busy season for you.",
        "It's nice to see everyone once in a while, but mostly I want to get back to the farm.",
        "Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer.",
        "Hey. I'm paying my respects to another bygone summer. I'll come meet up with you when we launch the candle-boat.",
        "I really admire Robin's carpentry skills. I use a lot of the same techniques in my own line of work.",
        "I learned all of Robin's techniques last year, but she's always one step ahead of me!",
        "Mm, hi. Sorry... mouth full of blackberries.",
        "I may have had a little too much pumpkin ale...",
        "Oh, ice. A beautiful material to sculpt in, but so impermanent.But I guess that might make the art even better.",
        "Hmmm... a Lupini original? Not bad...",
        "Gus was just telling me about his artisan candy canes. *yawn* I think he had too much cinnamon nog.",
        "I'm thankful for our simple life on the farm.",
        "This house is a lot nicer than my old cabin! I don't miss it.",
        "Always remember to keep your eyes peeled for wild food! There's lots out there.",
        "Mind if I add some architectural flair to the woodwork around here? My chisel hand is itching!",
        "One of these days I'll have to do your portrait.",
        "The view from this window is inspiring, don't you think?",
        "Good morning, [Player]. I've planted these in a little pot out back... I grew that with great love and attention. Enjoy it.",
        "I was thinking... life's too short to eat bad food. Luckily, we live in one of the best regions for fresh greens and vegetables! Here, I made you a healthy salad. I'm surprised you aren't sick of my salad yet!",
        "Good morning, [Player]! I made us some coffee. My morning just wouldn't be complete without a hot cup of coffee.",
        "The cool breeze feels nice. It reminds me of living by the river.",
        "Hmm... I'm going to do some maintenance over here. I just get the urge to do some hammering now and then.",
        "It's going to be a special day, I can sense it.",
        "Ah... that smell of fresh dirt. There's nothing quite like it. You can just tell the air is clean here... it feels good in the lungs.",
        "Don't overwork yourself, dear. Make sure to take a break every now and then, or get something to eat.",
        "Wow, this is great! I'm really starting to enjoy life on the farm, [Player]. This is the life I've always dreamed of.",
        "Something about this time of night makes me thirsty.",
        "The flow of time is so delicate... even the tiniest decision changes the future forever.",
        "It's so much lovelier here at night than the garish glow of the city. Everything worked out perfectly for me. I'm very lucky.",
        "I never thought I'd receive a mermaid's pendant so soon after moving here! I'm happy about it, though.",
        "I saw a wild rabbit today. I just wish I could pet one someday. They look so soft...",
        "It's so quiet and peaceful in the evening. Nothing to distract you from the experience of living.",
        "I sometimes find inspiration in the most unlikely of places.",
        "I used to find rain depressing when I lived in the city. But here in Stardew Valley it's beautiful.",
        "It's days like these I'm glad for my heavy-duty boots!",
        "The trees have been begging for this rain... I'm happy for them.",
        "Might want to do some fishing or mining today, huh?",
        "Good morning! I got up early and did some mushroom hunting. Here, take one. Searching for mushrooms is like going on a treasure hunt. It's a lot of fun.",
        "How was your day? Did you see any animals out there?",
        "I usually go for salad, but a wet night like this gives me cravings for hot soup.",
        "It's going to be relaxing to fall asleep on a night like this...",
        "I made a little wood sculpture today, but it was so ugly I threw it into the fire. I think to become a great artist, you have to be critical of your own work.",
        "I'm glad you're home... It's a good night to get under the covers and stay warm.",
        "How was your day today, dear? Muddy?",
        "I'm going to take a nature walk today. I need to get out of the house.",
        "Hello, [Player]. I'm just enjoying the fresh air for a while. I was starting to get cabin fever at home.",
        "I had a nice, relaxing time today. How did your day go?",
        "Dear, I'm pregnant. Isn't it wonderful?",
        "It's fun to be a parent. I want to make sure [child] grows up to have a love for the outdoors.",
        "We've got a wonderful farm and a full family. Our new life has really turned out well, hasn't it?",
        "Living here, I feel like I'm on the summit of a great mountain.",
        "Did I ever tell you... when you first moved here I had a dream that we'd be together someday.",
        "Sometimes it's hard not to believe in destiny... the fact that I decided to move here, and that we found each other. It could've gone entirely differently at any point.",
        "Wow, you look [full of energy/beautiful] today!",
        "Mmm... You smell nice today.",
        "I was just admiring my wedding amulet... I'll cherish this treasure for the rest of my life.",
        "I wonder who lived here before us?",
        "Don't you have anything to do today?",
        "Don't forget to look for wild horseradish, leeks and dandelions while you're out there!",
        "That was some way to ring in the new year last night...",
        "So, what are we planting this season?",
        "*sigh*... I guess it's time for the 'spring cleaning' again.",
        "Finally! I was starting to get worried you wanted to dance with someone else!",

        "Winter's here, and that means crystal fruit is in season. It has such a unique flavor, don't you think?",

        "I'm thankful for our simple life on the farm.",

        "I think we've both found what we were looking for in this place. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else, but here with you.",
        "I've realized I'm happier by myself. So just leave me be.",
        "So why did you become a farmer?"

Friendly, outgoing, and ambitious, Maru would be quite a lucky match for a lowly newcomer such as yourself' Can you win her heart, or will she slip through your fingers and disappear from your life forever?",

        "Hey, what's this, a birthday gift? It's... uh, well, it's a gift! Thanks for remembering me, anyway.",
        "Is that...? Oh wow, (Name)! This is spectacular!",
        "This will be perfect for powering my latest project! Thanks, (Name)!",
        "Ooh, this is exciting! I'll deconstruct it and see if I can reverse-engineer the technology.",
        "Ah, pure gold... It's not the strongest material, but it has some really useful properties!",

        "This is a super gift! Thank you!",
        "Thanks.",
        "Oh... That's for me? I'll just put it over here...",
        "Yuck! You thought I would like this?",
        "Oh! Aren't you the one who just moved in?I'm Maru. I've been looking forward to meeting you!You know, with a small town like this, a new face can really alter the community dynamic. It's exciting!",
        "Whenever I'm struggling with a technical problem, I always take a walk.It's surprising how much a change of scenery can help.",
        "Have you met my mother? She's the town's carpenter.",
        "On Tuesdays and Thursdays I work at Harvey's clinic.He says he likes having me around in case his medical equipment goes haywire! Being a farmer must be pretty easy, huh?",

        "Hey, have any interesting farm stories to tell me? Guess not",

        "Mmmm... Why are tropical fruits so good?",
        "I wonder if Willy would let me bring my telescope here sometime... The sky is so clear here, I bet I could spot Pelican Town out in the horizon. Maybe I'd even see you running around [Farm Name] Farm!",
        "That was fun!",
        "How do your hands stay so soft with all that farm work?",
        "You have a leaf in your hair. Let me get it for you.",

        "I'm flattered! But... No.",
        "I didn't practice much beforehand but I'll give it my best for the both of us",
        "Of course... *whisper* Then can we go home and snuggle?",
        "Whatever Linus is roasting smells awfully good... *slurp*",
        "Harvey keeps trying to talk to me, but all I want is a piece of this roast.",
        "It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner.",
        "Do you think I have enough time to grab my telescope from the farmhouse?",
        "Hmm... probably not. I don't want to miss this!",
        "*slurp* mmm... this barbecue sauce is amazing.",
        "mumph... This is my one chance to pig out on barbecue sandwiches.",
        "I think I've already been this way... no, wait... I'm lost...",
        "I'm confused... you go on ahead and let me figure this out.",
        "I'm not very creative when it comes to snowmen.",
        "You'll do great out there, honey! Just stay calm and focused.",
        "Wow, the tech on this thing is amazing!",
        "Hi, [Player].",
        "Hey, [Player]. I'm ready to head home whenever you are.",
        "Hmm? Sorry, sometimes I get so lost in thought that I don't even realize what I'm doing.",
        "Finally, you're up! I was getting so hungry... *rumble*",
        "One of the best things about living on the farm is waking up to a chorus of songbirds.",
        "How do you keep your hands so soft with so much farmwork?",
        "If you ever want to talk about how to maximize crop yield or anything... I'm open to that!",
        "I got up early to do a little stargazing. I hope you don't mind if I spend some time on my projects today, honey.",
        "I found this in my scrap pile. Think you could find a use for it?",
        "Ahh... the farm smells great, it reminds me of the mountains near my parent's house.",
        "With a little planning, we could automate most of the farm work and just relax!",
        "It's going to be clear tonight... I wonder if the [random noun] constellation will be visible?",
        "Don't worry, I won't mind if you track mud into the house. It's fun to get a little dirty now and then.",
        "I never realized the amount of care and planning necessary to run a farm! It's a lot like working in the laboratory.",
        "I like being out here. It's a good place to think about new inventions. I'm still hoping to come up with something to help you out in your work.",
        "I'm not sure what this is, yet... but it's fun to turn the old wrench now and then.",
        "Did you see the moon tonight? It always looks spectacular on the horizon.",
        "I saw a shooting star earlier. I like to pretend it's MarILDA stopping by to check up on us.",
        "I can't decide if I'm craving chocolate cake or ripe strawberries. Or maybe both...? Be honest, am I gaining weight?",
        "You did good work today! You deserve to relax the rest of the evening.",
        "I'm really starting to love this old house. It's so cozy at night. Mom's done a great job improving the place.",
        "You look like you're ready for bed, [player], Should I lull you to sleep with the technical details of my latest project? *yawn* ...To be honest, I'm kind of sleepy too.",
        "I wonder how Penny is doing? Maybe I'll give her a call later today.",
        "I was just daydreaming... do you think MARILDA is okay? I hope she finds some place where she truly belongs...",
        "The only thing I dislike about rain is the fact that I can't do any stargazing!",
        "Do I hear a leak in the roof? I'll have to check it out. I know a thing or two about carpentry from watching my mother.",
        "Despite all the technology we have, a rainy day is still the best tool for watering crops.",
        "Hey! I had trouble sleeping last night so I fiddled around in my workshop for a bit. Here, I made this for you. I hope you can find some use for it.",
        "Make sure you don't leave your tools out in the rain! You wouldn't want them to get all rusty.",
        "Hi (spouse name). How was your day, soggy? This weather gives me gadget ideas. Maybe if I funnel the rainwater I could power a mill?",
        "Dad's been tracking the weather patterns for the last twenty years. It's a little too early to tell, but the results have revealed some abnormal trends.",
        "My day wasn't all that exciting... I stayed inside because of the weather. It was relaxing, though. I kicked back with the latest 'Schematics Weekly'.",
        "Can we have spaghetti in bed tonight?",
        "Were you able to accomplish much today, hun? I tried to fix up some things around the house... you know, just little stuff.",
        "I made some dessert! Make sure to brush your teeth before bed, though.",
        "...I found you unconscious in the mines. You were gone so long I started to get worried about you! Be a little more careful next time, okay?",
        "I think I'll visit my parents today. I haven't seen them in a while.",
        "Mom and Dad are doing just fine. Their routine is still the same, even with me gone. How was your day?",
        "I have to leave for work soon. I'll see you tonight. I'll be thinking of you!",
        "Well, it was just another boring day at the clinic. Hey. Did you have a more exciting day than me? I hope so. Well, it's time to kick back and relax. Did you leave me any dinner? I'm just looking forward to bed-time.",
        "Have you spent any time with [child] today? Kids need playtime in order reach their full potential.",
        "What do you think... will [child] grow up to be a farmer? Or an engineer?",
        "I have high hopes for our child. I've been reading all the scientific data on the best ways to raise children.",
        "My own workshop, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. Life is pretty good.",
        "Now that we live together, it's hard to imagine being alone again.",
        "Taking a break? That's good!",
        "For a while there I was considering building a robotic [husband/wife]. But you're a lot more fun!",
        "There's a lot of strategy to planning and running a farm. It's more intellectually stimulating than I thought!",
        "I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. This is a very rare specimen!",
        "Last night, I had a dream that I was looking through a gigantic telescope. I saw something moving in the [random noun] nebula. Kind of spooky.",
        "I hope you'd still like me even if I gained weight.",
        "I feel uninspired today.",
        "I'm feeling excited for a new year of farming, [Player]!",
        "It's wonderful to see all the plants and animals come back to life during the spring.",
        "So, what's your strategy for optimizing the farm this year?",
        "If my brother wasn't such a hermit I'd invite him over for dinner sometime.",
        "The evenings are so warm, it's really the best time of year for stargazing. Who knows what might up there?",
        "I like to catalogue the different insects I see in summer.",
        "I wonder if my brother will ever have the courage to ask Abigail out.",
        "The farm life is great, but I'm glad I still work at the clinic... It's an important service for the community.",
        "With every season, a new section of the night sky becomes prominent. It's fascinating to witness.",
        "Fall always reminds me of going out woodcutting with my mom... It might be that smell of freshly cut wood and sap.",
        "Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house. Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.",
        "I'm really looking forward to having rhubarb pie in the spring. Oh... that tang, that zest!",
        "So what are your plans for maintaining our income this winter? You could do some fishing or foraging... If you do any mining, promise me you'll be careful.",
        "I hope Dad's doing okay... he can get depressed in winter, when there's less opportunity for field research.",
        "The winters have been disturbingly mild lately.",
        "You've really accomplished a lot since you moved here, [Player]. It's incredible. I think it's safe to say that you were meant to be a farmer!",
        "We have nothing to say to each other.",
        "Hi! Do you have fun working on the farm?",
        "Sorry, I was just thinking about some gadgets I'm making. I've decided I'm going to build a robot someday."

        "I'm looking forward to seeing what your farm looks like in the spring. It's going to be so fresh and beautiful.",
        "Are you alright? We're all wondering what's going on...",
        "This strange weather is a good opportunity to get the kids interested in nature!",
        "A word of warning, my mother really hates '[name of random hated item]'. Just the thought of it can make her depressed.",
        "Did you know that my mother hates '[name of random hated item]'? She finds it absolutely awful. I'm not sure why.",
        "If you want my mother to dislike you, give her '[name of random hated item]'. She hates it with a passion. I think she might be allergic.",
        "What you did for my family is so generous. Thank you!",
        "There are some truly wonderful people in the world...",
        "The raindrops are really loud on the metal roof of our trailer. ...It's soothing, though.",
        "I'm going to go inside, I just wanted a quiet moment.",
        "I have an appointment at the clinic this afternoon.",
        "Hey! A little privacy, please?",
        "This island is so beautiful!",
        "This sand is so soft and fine. It feels great on my toes!",
        "I'm a little embarrassed wearing my bathing suit in public. I hope no one's looking...",
        "Somehow, the water here looks so different... I can hardly believe this is the same ocean I've been gazing at my entire life.",
        "The wind keeps making me lose my page, but it feels really great on the skin.",
        "I'm reading a book about a sailor who washes up on a deserted island. I wonder what I would do in that sort of a situation?",
        "I had a great time.",
        "Hey honey, do you mind standing a little to the left? Thanks, the sun was making it a little bit hard to read!",
        "... You want to get more serious? I feel the same way.",
        "... I... I see... *sniff* ... W... We can just be friends, then.",
        "[Player].. I'm a little scared. This is such a big change! Don't worry, I'm really happy, too.",
        "We're going to have a little farm family, soon. I'm so glad you feel this way about me.",
        "I can't bear to see you...",
        "You've left a permanent scar on my heart, [Player]. Still... I'm ready to speak to you again.",
        "The children have been looking forward to this festival for weeks.",
        "Hopefully Vincent will be able to find an egg this year... It would be good for him to feel like he's a contender.",
        "Maru's trying to convince me to eat a deviled egg. I'm just not sure I can stomach it...",
        "Thousands of years ago, this place was the homeland of an ancient civilization. I wonder what they were like?",
        "*gulp*... I'm nervous.",
        "Vincent asked me to dance with him. Isn't that cute?",
        "\"Oh... with me? Yes, of course!...Will you take the lead, though? I'm nervous...",
        "Oh... No, thanks.",
        "We do this festival every year to give the governor a taste of everything the valley has to offer.Mayor Lewis hopes it will get the governor on our good side. That's why he's so neurotic about the way the soup tastes.",
        "I'm just humoring some old friends. What I really want is a bowl of that soup.",
        "Life is so easy for a jellyfish... just letting the waves carry you onward forever.",
        "I won the wheel of chance ten times in a row and now the man won't let me play anymore...",
        "I hope we win the grange display contest!",
        "The vapor from this cauldron... it's making my head spin, but I can't seem to leave...",
        "Oh... These vapors... Hmmm... You look nice tonight.",
        "Hmm... What kind of snowman should we make?",
        "Are you entering the fishing contest this year, [Player]? My mom's pretty serious about winning.",
        "Can you smell that? The air is so spicy here...",
        "What a beautiful tree.",
        "I'm thankful to have met you...",
        "It's so peaceful here. I used to have the most horrific nightmares, but now I sleep like a baby.",
        "You know, I think I'll read a book today. I picked up something new from the library last time I was there. Gunther asked me to say hi.",
        "I love to hear about all the artifacts you've found. Archaeology is fascinating! To think... there may have been farmers at this very spot 10,000 years ago.",
        "Was I shy when we first met? It's funny to think about, now that we've come so far.",
        "This place is so big compared to the trailer, I feel overwhelmed... In a good way!",
        "Life sure is different since we got married...",
        "I always wanted my very own library. This is so charming. I like to do a little reading first thing in the morning. It gets my brain into gear",
        "Good morning, [Player]! I made you a hot breakfast. It's important to me that you leave here with a full belly.",
        "I only ever dreamed of living in such a beautiful place, and now it's come true. I was so miserable back home.",
        "Isn't this the perfect place to raise children? I would've been so happy growing up on a farm.",
        "Hi honey, if I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry! I'll be thinking of you.",
        "I just saw a songbird flying due west. In Stardew Valley that's a very good omen.",
        "Ahh... It feels great to be outside. I could spend all day right here, observing every little thing.",
        "I'm really happy on our little farm, [Player].",
        "This is a lot more peaceful than my old spot in town. I'm very happy here.",
        "Good evening, honey. Did you accomplish everything you wanted to today? If not, that's okay. We've got all the time in the world!",
        "Hmm... skirt or pants tomorrow? Oh, who am I kidding... I always go with the skirt.",
        "We have it good here. We should always try and remember those less fortunate than us. I'm just grateful for what we have.",
        "Mom's probably pretty lonely now that I'm gone. I just hope she doesn't visit the saloon more to make up for it. You shouldn't feel bad! Mom has to solve her own problems.",
        "Ready to tuck in? I made the bed and everything...",
        "Hi there, honey. Ready to spend a quiet evening at home?",
        "On rainy days my thoughts always drift toward cinnamon and cookies.",
        "I wonder if Maru and Dr. Harvey will ever get together? I'm sure Harvey likes her... I think Maru will have to make the first move, though.",
        "Hmm... Maybe I should experiment with a new recipe. You liked the last recipe I made, didn't you, honey? What was it called... 'Chili de [Player]?'",
        "On days like this, I love to curl up with a good book.",
        "I think I might do some baking today.",
        "Hi, honey! I did some shopping this morning and got this for you. I thought you could really use one of the those.",
        "How was your day, honey? I spent my afternoon reading a novel.",
        "I'm sure Mom's at the saloon right now... But I don't feel so bad about it anymore. It's out of my hands.",
        "I was just thinking about that night we met in the bathhouse. I'll never forget that night",
        "The sound of rain used to bother me, when I lived in that old metal trailer. But it's quite soothing here.",
        "Oh... the smell? I tried to do some baking... It didn't work out too well.",
        "I felt like making a nice dinner. I hope you like it.",
        "I'm going to head into town today, just for fun. I'll be back in awhile!",
        "I had a nice time... It's good to stay in contact with everyone. Tell me about your day.",
        "Hi, honey! I'm just doing some shopping.",
        "Don't worry, I'm using my own money to buy this.",
        "I wonder if Maru will get married some day?",
        "Hey honey, do you mind standing a little to the left? Thanks, the sun was making it a little bit hard to read!",
        "Hi, honey. It's nice of you to visit me at work.",
        "I have to go into town today. Don't work too hard, and eat something good for lunch!",
        "Good evening. My day was fine, thanks! How was yours? Jas and Vincent weren't behaving very well today. I'm still all wound up...",
        "[Player]... I still can't believe we're married...",
        "I had dreams of marrying you for such a long time.",
        "I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here...",
        "This place is really starting to feel like home.",
        "Be careful out there! Sometimes I worry that you aren't eating enough wholesome food.",
        "I was just admiring my wedding amulet. The shell is flawless. It must have cost you a fortune!",
        "Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave?",
        "Wow, you look beautiful today. Did you do something different with your hair?",
        "Sweetie, I'm pregnant. Isn't it wonderful?",
        "Have you had any time to play with [child] today? Maybe a second child will make things better.",
        "Little [child] is going to have such a great childhood here.",
        "I feel a lot older now that we have a child. Maybe it's just this new responsibility weighing on me. It's not bad! I've wanted this for a long time.",
        "I already gave [child] and [child] their food. They're such hungry children!",
        "We have to make sure and give [first child] a lot of attention now that we have [second child]. We don't want any jealousy between them.",
        "I've had this dream that [child] grew wings and flew into the night sky. What does it mean?",
        "A nice house, two wonderful kids, and a beautiful plot of land. We're so very fortunate.",
        "I'm so happy to see some greenery after that long white winter.",
        "We've got a long, warm year to look forward to. Let's make it a productive one.",
        "Spring is probably my favorite season. There's a certain freshness in the air that fills me with hope.",
        "Ah, the 'spring cleaning'... I'm going to actually enjoy this.",
        "*whisper* Thanks for going through with the formalities, dear.",
        "Are you growing any melons this summer?",
        "Summer may be searing hot, but the humidity feels great on the skin.",
        "In summer, the ants become very active. I could watch them for hours. They have a pretty complex civilization from the looks of it!",
        "*phew*... I need to eat more melon to combat this heat!",
        "It's so peaceful out here on the farm. I never appreciated nature that much living in town.",
        "Fall... It makes me think of colored paper and glue. Maybe I'm spending too much time with the children.",
        "Will you grow any giant pumpkins this year?",
        "The smell of fall reminds me of the smell of books... weird, isn't it?",
        "\"I'm going to do a lot of reading this winter.",
        "Winter's a good time to unwind a bit. You deserve it after the long year!",
        "How will we stay afloat this winter? Oh, you don't have to tell me... I trust you to make the right decisions.",
        "The falling snow reminds me of grandma, rocking by the fire. I mostly remember her shadow flickering against the orange wood. That was long ago.",
        "We have a beautiful home and a thriving family... it's all I've ever dreamed of, and more.",
        "...Please, leave me alone.",
        "*sigh*... My mother definitely has a problem with going to the saloon too much. But it's best not to dwell on bad things, right?"
