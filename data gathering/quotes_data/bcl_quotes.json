        "Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to 'look cool?'",
        "Aw yeah, that's the good stuff... Thanks for the birthday gift, <player>.",
        "You remembered my birthday? I'm impressed. Thanks.",
        "Oh, is it my birthday today? I guess it is. Thanks. This is nice.",
        "For my birthday? Thanks.",
        "What the...? Uh, I dunno what it's like where you grew up, but to me, this is trash.",
        "Hey, awesome! I love this stuff!",
        "Aw, yeah... I've been looking for this one. It's supposed to be full of tips for bulking up. Rule number one... Eat a ton of eggs! Hah, no problem! Thanks!",
        "Whoa... this is great. Thanks!",
        "This is cool! Thanks.",
        "Hey, thanks. Eggs are great for bulking up. *crack*... *sluuurp*... Mmmm. Now that's what I call a snack.",
        "Now that's what I call an egg! Imagine the size of the omelet...",
        "Mmm... Duck egg... Rich and creamy. *crack*... *slurp*. Ahhhh...",
        "*crunch*... Mmm... Nuts. That hits the spot. Thanks, (Name)!",
        "Hehe... Keep giving me these every day, and I'll be able to retire at thirty!",
        "Whoaa... It's so heavy I could use it for bicep curls. I'll be slurping on this for a week! Hah hah!",
        "Can you eat this? I guess there's only one way to find out...",
        "Thanks!",
        "Umm... I know I'm pretty big on eggs... But this isn't what I meant... Oh well... Down the hatch! *gulp*",
        "Um... Okay. Thanks.",
        "Uhhh... Reading? Yeah, um... I guess I can give it a try.",
        "Oh... um... I usually like eggs, but this one looks evil.",
        "Are you serious? This is garbage.",
        "Oh, hey. So you're the new guy, huh? Cool. I'm Alex. I'll see you around.",
        "Hey, you're the new girl, huh? I think we're going to get along great. I'm Alex. I'll see you around.",
        "Did you know I was an all-star quarterback in high school? It's true. See this little star on my jacket here? That proves it.",
        "The air's starting to warm up... I'm feeling pumped.",
        "My arms are really sore, but that's the sign of progress for a guy like me. I must've done a thousand push-ups yesterday.",
        "Hey. What, you wanna talk to me? I'm busy.",
        "Hey, [Player]. That's right, I remember your name.",
        "Hey, [Player]. How's your day going?",
        "Hey, [Player]. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm not ashamed to say that I love my Grandma!Now Grandpa, on the other hand... Just kidding.",
        "The beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays. You gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale. Hey, do you wanna hang out with me at the beach some time? Do you have a bikini?",
        "Hey, it's farm girl. Did you get new pants? You're doing something right. Oh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups! Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?",
        "The beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays. You gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale. *sigh*... I wish there were more girls in this town, know what I mean?",
        "Hey, what's up farmer guy? Oh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups! Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?",
        "Hey, so I picked up [item] at the store last night. Grandma made her special casserole...",
        "Nothing's better than an energetic day at the beach with your friends... right?",
        "You know, I used to want fame and fortune, but lately I've been starting to sing a different tune. In the end it's the humble little things that satisfy, don't you think?I still want to go pro, but it's not the most important thing in the world.",
        "Hi [Player]. You look sporty today.",
        "Hey [Player]. Did you do something different with your hair? Something keeps grabbing my attention.",
        "What do you think of my haircut?",
        "Looks Like a good day to play catch, huh.",
        "I'd ask you to throw the ball around, but you don't really seem like the sports type.",
        "If you weren't a girl I'd ask you to play catch.",
        "Hey. Summer is definitely the best time of year. Right now is great because we've got the whole season to look forward to. Catch you later.",
        "If my hair wasn't so popular with the ladies, I swear I'd shave it all off in a second. *sigh*... Life can be tough.",
        "What do you want? I've got more important things to do right now.",
        "Mmm... I smell a barbecue. Damn I could go for a burger.",
        "I got these new shoes yesterday 'cuz my old pair had a brown smudge. I just threw them into the garbage. I would've donated them but I don't like the idea of some weirdo wearing my shoes, ya know? ...What?",
        "Oh wow...your shoes are a little dirty... but that's fine, too! Different people have different tastes I guess.",
        "Hey, you look like you're getting into some good shape this summer! All that farm work is paying off, huh?",
        "Hey, nice tan.",
        "The beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays. You gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale. Hey, do you wanna hang out with me at the beach some time? Do you have a bikini?",
        "Hey, it's farm girl. Did you get new pants? You're doing something right. Oh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups! Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?",
        "Hey Farmer girl. You've got a nice tan going. The more I practice this summer, the easier it'll be for me to go pro. Then you'd be able to say you knew me once. Cool, huh?",
        "Hey, you must be getting pretty fit working on that farm all day. Maybe you'll reach my level some day. Something to look forward to, huh? Why do you have that look on your face?",
        "The beach is a cool place to hang out and soak up some rays. You gotta spend some time in the sun or else you'll get all pale. *sigh*... I wish there were more girls in this town, know what I mean?",
        "Hey, what's up farmer guy? Oh, I almost forgot! It's my day for doing push-ups! Every time I do push-ups I try to do one more than last time. Pretty cool strategy, huh?",
        "Hey, farmer guy. You look a little burnt. The more I practice this summer, the easier it'll be for me to go pro. Then you'd be able to say you knew me once. Cool, huh?",
        "Hey, you must be getting pretty strong working on that farm all day. Maybe you'll reach my level some day. Something to look forward to, huh? Why do you have that look on your face?",
        "Sorry my room is so messy. It's just hard to always remember to clean. I'm trying to get better, though.",
        "You know, I actually wouldn't mind being a farmer... it seems a lot like playing sports, in a way. I like being outdoors and doing things with my hands.",
        "Sure, it's getting colder... But it's still warm enough for sports! That's all I care about.",
        "My Grandma told me I should spend more time studying. I was like, '...Grams, don't fret. I'm turning pro!'Studying is for nerds, anyway.",
        "What's up? Isn't your name, like, [name with the same first letter as Player], or something?Oh. It's [Player]? Okay. Sorry.",
        "I'm going to do two hundred sit-ups tonight. I'm pretty dedicated, aren't I? Need anything else?",
        "I think you can find salmon in the river this time of year. At least that's what I heard.",
        "Hey, the gridball game is on today! Sundays are pretty awesome in the fall.",
        "What's up, [Player]?",
        "My Grandma told me I should spend more time studying. Maybe she's right...",
        "I'm going to do a ton of sit-ups tonight. You have to work really hard if you want to achieve your maximum potential.",
        "I finally took the plunge... I've decided to stop putting gel in my hair. I wouldn't want to be friends with someone who only liked me because I have gel in my hair.",
        "Winter is kind of lame. There's too much snow to do anything fun. I guess some people like it.",
        "You like the snow? Me... I'm just looking forward to spring.",
        "Hey, can you go find Haley and tell her I said 'hi'?",
        "People stay indoors a lot during the winter, and do boring stuff. Maybe if I read a book I'd be less bored... nah.",
        "When I turn pro, I'll be so rich that I'll get a vacation home in the tropics. Then I won't have to deal with these boring winters.",
        "You came all the way through the snow to see me? I guess that makes sense.",
        "There's some weird people living in this town. ...like that guy Sebastian. Why does he wear black all the time? I don't get it.",
        "You came all the way through the snow to see me? That's nice of you.",
        "Hey, [Player]. Could you do me a favor? If you see Haley, tell her I'm busy. Thanks.",
        "Hey, the gridball game is on today! This might be my favorite day of the week.",
        "I'll admit... I was a little jealous when you and Haley got married. But, hey... It's a chance for me to learn something new about myself.",
        "Oh, hey. How's the married life coming along?",
        "I guess it's interesting that some people are totally different than us, you know?I don't always understand why others act the way they do, but that's fine.",
        "I wish I could control the weather.",
        "You know what? I'm going to start reading a book!",
        "What's going on out there? Any action? I gotta stay here with my grandparents...",
        "I tried to go for a run this morning, but the plants have gone crazy! I couldn't get very far...",
        "Finally, we're here!",
        "Ah... The island life. I could get used to this!",
        "I knew I shoulda brought a frisbee... Oh well.",
        "I wonder if anyone would be up for a volleyball tournament. Don't worry, I'll go easy!",
        "I wonder how far I could swim out, and still make it back? I'm guessing at least a mile. ... Don't worry, I'm not going to try it.",
        "With this island open, there's no excuse to be pasty anymore!",
        "Phew, it feels good to finally get these abs a little sunlight. Kind of a shame to have them hidden away all the time back home.",
        "When I go pro, I'll vacation on islands all around the world. But for now, this place will do just fine!",
        "I'm ordering a banana shake with two scoops of protein powder.",
        "Aw... I guess it can't last forever.",
        "...You want to get more serious? I feel the same way.I'm kind of nervous. Aren't you?",
        "...!!I'll accept this...thank you. I didn't know you felt the same.",
        "I've been having a hard time staying focused lately.",
        "I've been trying to do more reading lately... I feel like I've been neglecting my brain for years because of my athletic obsession.",
        "[Player]! Um... Hi.",
        "If I ever make a lot of money, I'll make sure all my friends and family are taken care of. That means you, too.",
        "Hey [Player]. Did you do something different with your hair? Something keeps grabbing my attention.",
        "...!!!...I accept!!...I'll set everything up. We'll have the ceremony in 3 days, okay?",
        "[Player], this is the greatest thing that could have happened...I can't wait.",
        "I'm going to love being a farmer.",
        "You're not worth my time.",
        "I don't know if I can trust you anymore, but I'm willing to give you a chance.",
        "I try to eat at least three eggs every day. I need that protein for my legs.",
        "I wonder what would happen to my arms and legs if I ate thirty eggs a day?",
        "Ungh... I think I ate a dozen too many hard boiled eggs...",
        "I'm just enjoying the scenery...hehe.",
        "You beat me to it! I was about to ask you...",
        "I'll see you out there.",
        "Nah... I'm gonna ask someone else. Good luck.",
        "Perfect weather for a beach party, huh?",
        "Hey, I'll take any excuse to come hang out at the beach. This weather is amazing!",
        "I can't believe summer's over... I feel like it just started.",
        "I played the 'Strength' game too many times and now my arms feel like rubber.",
        "I'm just catching up with some old friends... you go on and have a good time.",
        "There's something weird over there. But how do I get to it?There's gotta be a secret passage somewhere around here.",
        "Snowmen are okay, I guess. But mostly I'm looking forward to the Spring.",
        "I'll be rooting for you in the fishing competition.",
        "Have you seen the mermaid show? It's my favorite...",
        "Oh, hello.",
        "What am I thankful for? I'll show you when we get back home...",
        "Come here. *squeeze*... Mmhmm. You're firming up from all that farm work.",
        "Ahh... there's nothing like a good night's sleep next to my [wife/husband]!",
        "I'm still getting used to cooking and doing laundry...It's not exactly my favorite, but I knew what I was getting into when I married you.",
        "There's a couple things around the house that I'm going to try and fix today. Don't worry about me, I'm not bored.",
        "Hey honey! I made you a hot breakfast. If you wanna get strong, you have to eat like you mean it!",
        "The sun's shining and I'm bursting with energy! You'd better watch out! Heh Heh.",
        "Don't ever let me get lazy. I want to stay in good shape for you!",
        "There's lots of room here to do my exercises. I'm making more progress than ever!",
        "Look at us, with our little farm. We make a cute couple. Hey. Maybe it's the golden light, but you look beautiful today.",
        "I like to spend as much time outside as possible. It just feels better to be out here.",
        "Ahh...It feels great to be outside. Stardew Valley really is the most beautiful place...",
        "Hey. When I stand here and look out over our land...I'm really proud. You've done great work..",
        "This is a great place to raise children. I would've loved growing up in a place like this. So much room to run around!",
        "I'm going to get a bunch of exercise done. Haha! I love living on a farm!",
        "Unghh.. one... Unghhh.. two... It feels great to lift weights outdoors!",
        "It's good to push yourself to the limit, doesn't it? You really feel that you earned your place in the soft bed tonight.",
        "Did you get a haircut or something? You're looking pretty good today. Maybe it's all that fresh air...",
        "Tell me about your day. It's good to get everything off your chest now and then.",
        "Hey...I got some new shorts. I thought you might be interested to know...",
        "If you need some quiet time to yourself, that's okay with me.",
        "I feel exhausted...That's a good sign! It means I worked hard enough today.",
        "My arms feel a little restless... How about a nice, deep massage?",
        "With all this space, I can really achieve a full body workout.",
        "I never had many friends in town... I sometimes wonder how I'd end up if you never moved here.",
        "Aw...I was gonna do some jogging outside. But I can't really do it in this weather.",
        "*grumble*... I just woke up and I'm hungry for some protein.",
        "I think I might start reading books. I don't want to become stagnant now that I'm a married guy.",
        "Hmm... I guess I'll have to do push-ups and sit-ups indoors today.",
        "Grandma always used to make hot stew on nights like this.",
        "Hey, did you have a good day? I'm sure tomorrow will be even better.",
        "How's it going? I've been carrying the old gridball around with me all day. A guy can pretend...",
        "Oh...the smell? I've been eating garlic all day. I'm trying to stay manly...Sorry.",
        "I've been setting aside a few scraps for Dusty. He deserves a treat now and then.",
        "I was hungry so I made some dinner. Here, I saved you a plate.",
        "I'm going to into town today. I'll see you tonight.",
        "I'm going to hang out here all day. My grandparents aren't getting any younger...",
        "I had a good day. I like to see my grandparents often, they're getting pretty old.",
        "You're very [beautiful/handsome]...have I told you that?",
        "<spouse name>... I will always love you.",
        "I know you're strong, but sometimes I worry that you might get eaten by slimes...or worse. Just be careful.",
        "This place is my home now...I'm happy here.",
        "I was just admiring my wedding amulet... The shell is flawless. It must have cost you a fortune!",
        "Don't worry about me...I know you've got a lot of responsibilities outside of the house. I'm fine in here by myself!",
        "I'm bored...",
        "*sigh*...",
        "*grumble*... chores...",
        "Nnnghh... what is it? Make your own breakfast.",
        "Dear, can't you tell? You're pregnant!",
        "<spouse name> we're going to have a baby soon!",
        "I'm still getting used to my new life as a stay-at-home dad.",
        "Little <child's name> is going to grow up strong, just like Daddy.",
        "I wonder what it's like to be pregnant...?",
        "Two beautiful children...We've come a long way, haven't we?",
        "Just look at our little family...We've come a long way, haven't we?",
        "We have to make sure and give <1st child's name> a lot of attention now that we have <2nd child's name>. We don't want any jealousy between them.",
        "I've aready given <1st child's name> and <2nd child's name> breakfast. They were hungry.",
        "Maybe <child's name> will be the first professional gridball player from Pelican Town?",
        "Everything went well, and now little <child's name> is part of the family. We're very fortunate.",
        "I finally have the family life that I missed out on as a kid...thank you.",
        "What do you think of the new wallpaper I chose?",
        "Now that winter's over, we've got lots of productive weather to look forward to.",
        "Hey [player]. Let's work hard today!",
        "Finally, the snow has melted and the sun is back! My body feels great.",
        "I wonder if a powder of stardrop would help me bulk up... ",
        "Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? I guess it'll be good to load up on the free eggs.",
        "Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I better do some extra push-ups tonight. Those jumpsuits are pretty tight... and everyone's going to be watching closely.",
        "Okey, this should be fun... I hope I can remember the moves this year! It's been a while...",
        "Summer's a very energetic time of year, and my body feels it too! I feel solid.",
        "I always have the most energy in the summer.",
        "Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup? I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!",
        "Aw... summer's almost gone. My muscles are starting to deflate...",
        "Well, summer's over... but I'm going to stay positive. The warmer seasons will always return.",
        "I feel weak... I need some protein.",
        "I hope my grandparents are doing okay. Grandpa's too cheap to turn on the furnace until the last minute.",
        "Tomorrow's the fair, are we going to go? I don't care one way or another.",
        "I'm just catching up with some old friends... you go on and have a good time.",
        "Make sure you stay warm this winter. I worry about your delicate skin.",
        "I hope my grandparents are doing okay. They used to rely on my help quite a bit. You know, with lifting heavy objects or whatever.",
        "Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow? I think you can win it!",
        "I'll be rooting for you in the fishing competition.",
        "What am I thankful for? I'll show you when we get back home...",
        "It's been a great year, <spouse name>. I'm looking forward to next year! Now, come closer.",
        "I've finally discovered who I want to be... and I feel certain about the future. I don't think I would've gotten here without you, [Player].",
        "I thought we had something special... I guess I was wrong,"

        "Elliott lives alone in a cabin on the beach. He is a writer who dreams of one day writing a magnificent novel. He is a sentimental romantic with a tendency to go off onto flowery, poetic tangents. When he can afford it, he enjoys a strong beverage at the Stardrop Saloon. Could a humble farmer such as yourself be the inspiration Elliott is looking for? There's only one way to find out'",
        "I'm honored that you would remember my birthday! Thank you!",
        "Another year gone by, another gray hair... I suppose this gift can commemorate my decline.",
        "(Name), this is a beautiful gift! Thank you!",
        "This will make a beautiful quill! I feel inspired already...",
        "Ah, a bottle of fine ink. A writer can never have too much... and it's quite expensive! Thank you!",
        "Ah, what a gift! The aroma alone is inspiring...",
        "This is for me? Marvelous!",
        "Ah, a book... Yes, perhaps the prose within these pages will offer a new insight. Thank you.",
        "Oh, a present! Thank you!",
        "Ah, you've been doing some beach combing... A fine hobby! Thank you.",
        "Hmm... I'm not a huge fan of this.",
        "This item gives me a terrible feeling. I'll have to dispose of it.",
        "Agh, it's still wriggling! Get that abomination away from me!",
        "Ah, the new farmer we've all been expecting... and whose arrival has sparked many a conversation!I'm Elliott... I live in the little cabin by the beach. It's a pleasure to meet you.",
        "I'm kind of new to this town myself, but I really feel at home. I moved here only a year before you.",
        "I hope you've come to think of this place as 'home'.",
        "A great idea can pass through your head when you least expect it... but if your mind is too busy you might miss it. Well, I really must get back to my work.",
        "The sweet friction of pen and paper is the music of my soul. That's why I chose this beach as my home, so that I could have peace and quiet to do my work.",
        "The forest is a wonderful place. Have you been there?",
        "I can't seem to find the inspiration to begin writing my novel...",
        "I've been feeling hopeful lately. Perhaps the weather is changing.",
        "Hello, [Player]. Are you well?",
        "The fresh air of this valley is good for body and mind. A quick stroll outdoors always invigorates me.",
        "I'll admit... it takes me several hours each morning to make my hair look this good.",
        "You probably wouldn't like it inside my cabin. It's dark and full of spiders.",
        "Please excuse the sorry state of my cabin.",
        "Hello. I hope your new farming life is panning out as you'd hoped?",
        "Ah... do not get too close to my hair with a torch...",
        "Sometimes when I lay in bed I can hear a distant foghorn cut through the rain. But when I look out the window I see only a curtain of gray.",
        "I saw that Pierre had fresh [item] in the shop the other day! Marvelous. It smelled just perfect... and firm, too!",
        "Sometimes I wonder if I might just have an inflated self-image and no real skills... No, no... I'm not fishing for compliments. Though they are appreciated...",
        "Some people are shy. Keep showing interest in them and they'll get comfortable around you. Everyone likes to have friends, even that grumpy blacksmith.",
        "Oh, [Player]! I was hoping you'd show up. It's always a pleasure to see you.",
        "Sorry, I'm feeling morose today. I wish there was more certainty about the future. I don't want to grow old as a lonely hermit on this beach...",
        "It's a little lonely out here on the beach... so I apologize if I was ever a little too forward with you when we first met. I was just eager to have a friend. It feels good to have a close friend like you.",
        "A gentle little sunbeam woke me up this morning. I've never felt so refreshed. I'm sorry if that isn't very interesting to you.",
        "I know that I am kind of an 'oddball'. I hope you don't mind.",
        "I've encountered some beautiful shells in front of my house. I would imagine the rarer varieties to be quite valuable.",
        "It must be satisfying to follow your crop from seed to harvest. It's as if your essence is infused into the fruit.",
        "Oh dear! My shoes are filled with sand. That's the trouble with living on the beach.",
        "[Player]? You look puzzled. I guess the hot summer air can make us a little dizzy.",
        "The sun is angry today... My skin is a bit too delicate, I'm afraid.",
        "You came all the way here just to talk to me? How kind.",
        "Visit my cabin whenever you like. I could use the company.",
        "Hello there. What brings you to this terrible place?",
        "[Player], I know you have faith in my abilities as a writer. That means a lot to me.",
        "I write in hopes of connecting with others through time and space. *sigh*...times are changing, though. People don't read anymore.",
        "Hello [Player]. Make sure and take breaks from your work now and then.",
        "Come visit me if you need a break from your labors. I'm usually at my house.",
        "It's been said that a pirate's ship, full of plundered gold, shipwrecked here a long time ago.",
        "Oh dear! A tiny crab appears to have made his home in my shirt pocket. That's the trouble with living on the beach.",
        "My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all night. Sometimes I envy you, [Player].",
        "My legs are stiff from sitting at my writing desk all morning.",
        "[Player], when you're around... I feel unusually creative. I know... strange, but it's true.",
        "It gets windy this time of year. Marvelous!",
        "I have to remember to water my plants today. And not with sea water this time!",
        "[Player], I was just thinking about you. Maybe you sensed it. So! Tell me about your day.",
        "I wouldn't mind trying my hand at farming. The quiet atmosphere of a farm might be a good source of literary inspiration, don't you think?",
        "You've come to visit me in the cold? I could do with a respite from my lonely labors.",
        "[Player], you've trudged through the snow to visit me? I'm honored!",
        "People have scraped a living off the sea for thousands of years. I just go to the grocery store.",
        "A day can never be boring when you follow the whims of your imagination. Sorry, am I babbling on about nonsense?",
        "Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea. How does it make you feel?",
        "I have to brush my hair daily, or else it'll clump up into messy knots. It's a lot of work. I'm surprised I haven't just shaved it off in a fit of passion. I suppose I am too vain.",
        "I've been doing little indoor exercises, since it's often too cold to go out. Sorry if it's a little humid in the cabin.",
        "I really should scrub my floorboards today. I think an algae is starting to form. Do you make time for cleaning?",
        "Breathe deeply. Do you notice it? That's the smell of the sea. Whenever I smell the sea, it reminds me of my youth. The ocean really impressed me as a child.",
        "Let's not get in a tizzy, now... Gus! I propose a round of drinks to settle the nerves!",
        "Ah, yet another unique day in the valley. Stimulating, to say the least!",
        "That was quite the ride!",
        "I must admit, this beach blows my own humble strand out of the water.",
        "Oh dear! Some seaweed has tangled itself in my hair. That's the trouble with relaxing on the beach.",
        "I'm just taking a quick break to slather some coconut oil on my body.",
        "Gus, I'll order a round for everyone! *hic*... Oh... I don't have the G. Heh heh... Never mind!",
        "I've heard rumors of pirates coming to shore near here at night. They say it can get pretty wild!",
        "I'll see you back in the valley.",
        "Hopefully a crab hasn't snuck onto my clothes again. Imagine crawling out of a pocket and finding yourself on a beach hundreds of miles from home! Hmmm... Perhaps this could make for an interesting novel...",
        "...You want to get more serious? I feel the same way",
        "I'm kind of nervous. Aren't you?",
        "...!! I'll accept this. Thank you.",
        "I only wish I had given you a bouquet first!",
        "I didn't know you felt the same.",
        "[Player], I had a feeling that you would show up. Perhaps we're connected by an other-worldly thread",
        "Elliott whispers a sweet secret into your ear.",
        "...!!! I accept!! ... I'll set everything up. We'll have the ceremony in 3 days, okay?",
        "The farm will be such a lovely place to write. I'm really looking forward to this.",
        "We're going to make a great pair.",
        "Go away. I can't bear to see you.",
        "You've hurt me beyond measure... but I'm willing to leave the past behind us.",
        "Taking breaks from work can make you more productive in the long run.",
        "Be careful you don't accidentally take a raven's egg. They'll hold a grudge against you for the rest of their days!",
        "I enjoy seeing you so relaxed, my dear.",
        "*mumble* ...hmm, the toe feel is milky, but with plenty of body. Still, a bit mellower than back home...Oh, pardon me! I've become something of a sand connoisseur.",
        "I wore my best shirt for the dance... This sort of thing doesn't happen very often!",
        "To dance among a whimsical backdrop of flowers is an uplifting experience.",
        "Of course... it would be an honor! I look forward to it.",
        "Yes... could I refuse that soft, kind face? The touch of spring-time's sweet embrace?",
        "Excuse me... not today.",
        "I woke up late, stepped out of the door and found myself in the middle of all this hubbub! I forgot that today was the Luau.",
        "The old cabin seems to be holding up well. Every time I return I half expect the thing to be rotted...",
        "I would suggest we make time for a little 'rendezvous' in my old cabin... but I'm afraid it's become rather... musty... in my absence. ",
        "If we keep polluting the oceans, the jellies will surely go extinct. It's already in the process of happening.What a shame... we have no respect for nature anymore.",
        "Ah, I was wondering when you would arrive! We should head to the docks soon to greet our aquatic guests.",
        "I'm trying to get Gus to tell me his sauce recipe, but he won't budge.",
        "The smokey aroma drew me here, yet 'twas the zesty sauce that truly sealed my fate... *gurgle*",
        "Victory! I achieved a score of '216' with five fish caught... a new personal best! Now, I must choose a fitting prize to purchase for you with these star tokens...'",
        "Why, hello [Player]. It's chilly, isn't it?",
        "Mmph... I believe I've eaten a few too many slices of pumpkin pie.",
        "Oh pitiful wretch... in what fetid grotto lies your kingdom?Sometimes, one must stare into the abyss to stir a languid muse...",
        "I shudder to think what would happen if these got loose... Fear not, my dear! I would run the cursed wretch through, before it could lay a finger on you.",
        "I'm entering the ice fishing competition today. Why not?It's rare that Willy ever loses though.",
        "I know you'll beat me in the fishing competition, but I don't mind. I'm just here for the fun of it.",
        "I've been practicing my fishing technique. I won't hold back against you, my dear.",
        "A fleet of exotic merchants, traveling the world in search of riches beyond imagination... what an adventure!",
        "Why, hello [Player]. It's chilly, isn't it?",
        "You don't need to get me anything, you've already given me the greatest gift of all...",
        "My dear, I require nothing at all on this day... you are already the greatest gift a man could hope for.",
        "You've plucked Pelican Town's finest flower... Now, you must care for it with all your heart.",
        "The wedding was wonderful, wasn't it, dear?",
        "Well, we can't forget about the farm, time to get to work.",
        "I've been taking much better care of myself now that we're together. The bachelor life wasn't particularly healthy for me.",
        "If you find a spider in the house, don't squash it! Just let me know and I'll take the poor thing outside.",
        "Today is going to be a fantastic day... I can feel it! I get this special feeling in my nose...",
        "I've had this recurring nightmare that you gave me a buzz cut... you wouldn't ever do that to me, would you? I trust you.",
        "I've been keeping a journal ever since we moved in together. Now that I actually have a life, I have lots to write about. I want to make sure I always remember these years.",
        "I might stay here and write some poetry. I'm feeling a sudden surge of creativity! You go on ahead and take care of business.",
        "Sorry if I smell, I was sweating all night in the heat.",
        "If you go into town, make sure to say hi to everyone for me.",
        "Are we doing okay on money, (name)?",
        "I think I might do some writing today. Will you be okay without my help?",
        "Good morning, (name)! I made us a pot of coffee. I find myself craving this robust flavour nearly every morning.",
        "What do you think, hun?I figured the room could use a little more decoration.",
        "Today, I'm going to continue writing my new novel. What better place than our wonderful farm? This is perfect.",
        "My wildest dreams have come true... just look at this incredible landscape!",
        "Fertile soil beneath my feet, fresh air to fill my lungs, and the sun's warmth to delight my skin... Life is going well.",
        "I might stay here and write some poetry. I'm feeling a sudden urge of creativity! You go on ahead and take care of business.",
        "I drank too much coffee... my mouth feels about as dry as the Calico Desert. Oh... sorry about the coffee breath.",
        "If I stay perfectly still, perhaps a resplendent butterfly will bless my nose with a landing.",
        "I spent the morning repairing a few of the fences.. They should be as good as new. I also filled (Pet name)'s water bowl.",
        "I got up early and watered some crops for you. I hope it makes your job a little easier today. I also filled (Pet name)'s water bowl.",
        "Ah, what a lovely day to read a book... don't you think, my dear?",
        "A crackling fire adds wonderful ambiance to the house... every piece of wood burns in a unique way.",
        "I never had much success growing plants in my old beach house. Hopefully I can pick up a thing or two by watching you.  In this respect, you are the master and I only a humble apprentice.",
        "When I behold thy wondrous face, a precious jewel of form and grace, my heart... torn by the dread of night, is purified with golden light. Poetry is the only way I can begin to describe my feelings for you.",
        "You always smell so good after a hard day of work. It's your natural musk!",
        "You smell sweet, my dear. Like a honeycomb drifting on a pool of spice tea.",
        "Come here, let me massage your back. You look tense.",
        "You smell sweet, my dear. Like a cinnamon leaf floating in the summer breeze.",
        "My love... I wouldn't trade you for 100 iridium bars.Nor 1000...Not even 10,000 bars, no....No, not even 100,000 bars!Wa...one million bars of pure iridium...? Don't make me do this...",
        "From the brightest winter star, to the shimmer of an iridium vein... nothing can compare to my wonderful man.",
        "From the brightest winter star, to a fragrant fairy rose... nothing can compare with your captivating beauty.",
        "I feel inspired today... I think I'll do some writing.",
        "The sound of rain, in some tiny way, reminds me of my cabin by the beach. The farm is wonderful, but I do miss the sound of the ocean.",
        "I think I'll remain indoors today, my dear. The rain causes my hair to go limp.",
        "My inspiration for writing is like the weather... It comes and goes at random. Today I feel entirely dull. Perhaps I'll read one of the classics to get my creative juices flowing.",
        "The rain makes me think of my old life by the ocean. Change is part of life. That's okay.",
        "I got up early and made coffee. I find that a cup of this exquisite brew makes the early morning a lot more pleasant.",
        "Good evening. Did you have a productive day, my dear?",
        "You're ice cold! Let me keep you warm.",
        "My skill with words is unmatched, yet I can't find the way to properly describe your [allure/beauty].",
        "What did I do today? I'll just say this... it takes a lot of work to maintain this rugged physique!",
        "Sit down, relax! You've got to be tired after trudging through the mud all day.",
        "I spent the afternoon dreaming about the ocean. So I decided to cook some seafood.",
        "I think I'll walk down to the beach today, it's always nice to see the ocean again.",
        "I had a nice time at the beach by myself, I watched the waves come and go, just like old times.",
        "[Player]... I'm so proud of all your hard work. I'm very lucky to have you.",
        "I made a whole secret book of poems expressing my love for you.",
        "I came to the valley to find the ivory tower from which my talents could reign supreme. But what I really found was a dungeon of loneliness. You saved me from that.",
        "I feel burnt out in your absence. But when I hear that sound of muddy boots on wood, my heart rises from the ash.",
        "I'm doing a walking meditation. It's good for creativity.",
        "Be careful out there! I do worry about you sometimes. There are people in the world who would take advantage of you.",
        "Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave? Your jawline is perfect.",
        "Your feminine allure is irresistible today. I can't keep my eyes off you.",
        "So, I heard you secretly gave <name> a gift today. Do I have to be suspicious of you?...",
        "<spouse name> we're going to have a baby soon!",
        "[Term of endearment], can't you tell? You're pregnant.",
        "<spouse name>, I hope our adoption request gets approved. I want a baby.",
        "Hun, I filed our adoption papers. Now all we can do is cross our fingers and wait.",
        "Have you had any time to entertain little (First child's name) today? Maybe a second child will make things easier for both of us.",
        "Little (First child's name) is going to have the perfect childhood here. There's so much to explore.",
        "Caring for babies isn't exactly my strong suit... but I'll do my best to be a good father.",
        "I already gave (First child's name) and (Second child's name) their food. They eat a lot for such small creatures.",
        "I was carrying (First child's name) earlier and I could've sworn I heard a \"Da...da\".",
        "I'm going to teach (First child's name) to read as soon as possible! That's a great way for children to learn about the world.",
        "We've done well, [Player]. The farm is doing excellent and our healthy children are a great joy. I couldn't be happier.",
        "Just look at our little family... We've come a long way, haven't we?",
        "You were gone so long I started to get worried about you! I started crying when I saw your limp body.",
        "I'm looking forward to a beautiful year on [farm name] farm.",
        "My new year's resolution is to write, write and write! I can never stop improving my skills.",
        "It's strange, but I often have cravings for pomegranate in the spring.",
        "I enjoy seeing you so relaxed, my dear.",
        "Well well well, what do we have here? A beautiful desert rose! Make sure to stay watered, dear.",
        "I look forward to dancing with you tomorrow, my dear.",
        "I wore my best shirt for the dance... This sort of thing doesn't happen very often!",
        "Yes...could I refuse that soft, kind face? The touch of spring-time's sweet embrace?",
        "One of the main things I miss about the ocean is the fresh fish.",
        "It's summer, which means the house is full of flies.Don't worry, I'll take care of them.",
        "It's hard to be in a foul mood when the sun is beaming and the butterflies are dancing on a Spice-berry breeze.",
        "I was going to grab an extra bottle of ink from my cabin today, but then I remembered the Luau is tomorrow. I'll just do it then.",
        "The old cabin seems to be holding up well. Every time I return I half expect the thing to be rotted...",
        "I would suggest we make time for a little 'rendezvous' in my old cabin... but I'm afraid it's become rather... musty... in my absence. ",
        "All good things must come to an end, including the joyful days of Summer. The key to happiness is to accept change without judgement.",
        "Ah... Fall. The warm sun drifts low in the sky, casting long shadows over waving fields of gold. It's a beautiful time of year, don't you think?",
        "Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house.Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.",
        "The splendor of Fall... A verdant banquet for all the senses to enjoy... has inspired some of the greatest poetry of all time.",
        "I might set my pride aside and sink my teeth into a sloppy, saucy barbecue sandwich tomorrow.",
        "The smokey aroma drew me here, yet 'twas the zesty sauce that truly sealed my fate... *gurgle*",
        "Would you still love me if I guzzled two gallons of pumpkin ale at the Spirits Eve Festival? Sometimes a man has primitive urges.",
        "Mmph... I believe I've eaten a few too many slices of Pumpkin Pie.",
        "I think I might do some writing this winter. There's not much else to do, anyway.",
        "Winter is a great time to read books and play the piano. Remember to pause and enjoy a quiet moment or two.",
        "I'm a little out of practice but I plan on entering the fishing contest tomorrow! you've got some stiff competition, dear.",
        "I know you'll beat me in the fishing competition, but I don't mind. I'm just here for the fun of it.",
        "You don't need to get me anything, you've already given me the greatest gift of all.",
        "Happy new year's eve, my dear. Please accept this Wine to celebrate.",
        "Yes, my dear, I'd love to see a movie with you! I'll meet you at the theater.",
        "Heh... it just dawned on me... We've reached the summit, but not just physically... metaphorically as well. How poetic!",
        "Why do you torment me? Can't you see you've shattered all my hopes and dreams?"

        "Oh! It's a... well, it's something. I didn't expect anyone to know it was my birthday today.",
        "It's for me? This is my favorite stuff! It's like you read my mind.",

        "It's for me? Thank you! This will be fantastic drizzled on some pasta.",
        "For me? What a gift! This looks fantastic!You know, on a physiological level, I wouldn't advise the consumption of alcohol...But there's no denying the benefit of kicking back and enjoying a glass of fine Stardew Valley wine!",
        "That's such a nice gift. Thank you!",
        "Thanks. That's very kind of you.",
        "Hmm... Are you sure this is healthy?",

        "It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Harvey, the local doctor. I perform regular check-ups and medical procedures for all the residents of Pelican Town. It's rewarding work. I hope you'll find your own work equally rewarding, in time.",
        "We sell a few over-the-counter medicines at the clinic... feel free to stop by if you're feeling exhausted. I know that being a farmer is pretty tiring work... don't overdo it!",
        "I feel responsible for the health of this whole community... it's kind of stressful. It's a pretty small community, and I'm fortunate to be able to build a good relationship with my patients.",
        "Feel free to stop by my office if you're ever feeling ill. You're young, though. You'll probably stay healthy without trying.",
        "I'd like to get to know you better, [Player]. Let's put aside our doctor-patient relationship.",
        "Remember to cover your mouth when you sneeze. Then make sure to wash your hands.",
        "Nutrition is important, so make sure and eat well. Try to increase your vegetable intake! Home-cooked meals are best. Do you cook?",

        "People don't get sick much during the summer. That's nice, but it also means less business for me.",
        "Have you been going into the mines, [Player]? It's a dangerous place. I recommend against it.",
        "When you eat certain foods you'll perform better. Eating a 'Farmer's Lunch' will give you the nutrition you need to water and harvest crops better!",
        "It's flu season, so you'd better be extra careful. Make sure to wash your hands often.",
        "I hate to say this, but I do make a lot more money during flu season. I guess if people stopped getting sick, I'd be out of business. Don't get the wrong idea! I want people to be healthy... really!",
        "I brought some medical supplies, just in case. Be careful out there!",
        "The first time this happened, we were all worried that the rain might be dangerous. But what if it's actually healthy for the body? Who knows... The plants seem to respond well to it, at least.",

        "It's nice to have an opportunity to relax now and then. The trouble is actually letting go of your worries...",
        "It's important to stay hydrated in this heat. I'm going to ask Gus if he has any coconut water!",
        "If you get burnt, a little aloe vera cream might help soothe the skin.",

        "You have a really healthy glow. That's good.",

        "Eggs definitely have a place in the well-balanced diet. Oops... I should take off my Doctor's hat for the time being.",
        "Eggs are fine, but I'd advise against eating thirty per day!",
        "How is everyone doing? I'm just taking a break for a little while. I'm looking forward to seeing you in the egg hunt!",
        "Going into the caves can be really dangerous. I hope there are no accidents, but still...I'll be here all day just in case.As a doctor, I'd normally recommend minimizing your exposure to serpent-infested caverns! But ultimately, it's your choice.",
        "I'm working up the courage to ask someone to dance with me.",
        "If you spend some time pondering the hardships of life, it can put things into perspective.Suddenly, dancing in front of the whole town in an ill-fitting suit doesn't seem so bad!",
        "Oh! I'm sorry... I, er... have plans to ask someone else.",
        "Oh! You... want to dance with me?...Yes. I'd love to!",
        "I've been looking forward to it all afternoon! You look radiant in the fresh spring air, my dear.",
        "Good thing I brought my sunscreen,I wonder if Maru could use some sunscreen on her shoulders?",
        "*pant*... *pant*... ahhhh, I can't wait for a bowl of piping hot soup...",
        "Oh dear... I've got sand in my socks...",
        "Well, summer's over. To be honest, I'll be happy to say goodbye to these blasted mosquitos!",
        "With each passing second, my anticipation grows...",
        "And just a few steps over there, Gus is grilling up a batch of pork ribs... Yikes.I've got some soul-searching to do...",
        "I'm astonished by the level of craftsmanship on display here. Some people are so talented!",
        "I'll wait here until you're ready to go home...",
        "Oh! You found me... The truth is, I got too scared so I came here to hide. Don't tell anyone.",
        "I'm afraid to say I'm quite puzzled on this one.",
        "Hi... I was hoping you'd find me here...",
        "Extreme temperatures can put your body under a lot of stress, so make sure to bundle up!Oh and enjoy the festival!",
        "I shouldn't have waxed my moustache this morning, it's frozen solid! Oh dear'",
        "Well, if you need an ice pick, you know where to find me...",
        "I'm dreaming of our warm fire back home...",
        "Winter can be a dreary season, but events like this make it a little brighter!",
        "I'm thankful there were no medical emergencies this year!",
        "Have you tried the pecan pie? It's my favorite.",
        "I'm feeling a little overwhelmed... thank goodness for this crisp air...",
        "I think we're all striving to reach some kind of balance in life. An equilibrium of complexity. For me, moving here was exactly what my body needed to find that balance.",
        "I'm going to study the medical literature today. It's important for me to keep up-to-date so I can give my patients the best care possible!",
        "I'm going to listen to some jazz music and finalize my medical reports today. What do you have planned?",
        "I was afraid of you when we first met. It's funny to think about now that we've come so far.",
        "The sky looks great today... so clear! From now on, I'm only going to go into the clinic when I have appointments. Otherwise I can just work from home!",
        "Hi (affectionate nickname)! I got up early and fed all the farm animals. I hope it makes your job a little easier today.",
        "I wonder who lived here before us?",
        "Good morning, [Player]! I made you a nutritious breakfast. Eggs are a good source of essential nutrients, so eat up.",
        "No air-traffic this morning, honey. But it's still fun to break out the equipment now and then. I'm working on a new model plane. It's so much more relaxing here than in my old apartment.",
        "This is a very safe spot. You go on ahead and take care of business, don't worry about me.",
        "I believe this must be the ideal place to raise children, scientifically. What do you think?",
        "I may not be the most exciting guy, but I'll stay loyal to you for the rest of my life.",
        "[Player]... you... you mean the world to me.",
        "As a scientist I'm fascinated by the delicate interplay of insect and plant life.",
        "This is so much nicer than being cooped up in the clinic all day. I love watching you on the farm... hehe",
        "You know, this 'journal of tendon dynamics' is actually bearable when I'm reading out here.",
        "You look exhausted, dear. Let me give you a massage tonight. I promise it will reduce the inflammation in your muscle tissue!",
        "I took it easy today... spent some time reading books, fiddled with my radio, and worked on a model airplane. It's important to take a day off now and then to relax... stress is unhealthy.",
        "Good evening... did you finish everything you needed to do today? Don't worry about me. I'm very self-sufficient. If you have more work to do go right ahead.",
        "It's stressful to be a doctor, so it's really great to live somewhere as relaxing as [farm name] Farm.",
        "Oh! I was just daydreaming about the circulatory system and forgot what I was trying to do. It's a classic doctor's problem.",
        "You look like you could use a good massage tonight. Doctor's orders... It's good for the circulation!",
        "It's a myth that rainy weather causes the flu. However, take care that you don't slip on the mud! I often worry about you.",
        "It was so incredibly lonely living above the clinic by myself... I'm much happier now.",
        "I woke up early, but I made sure not to wake you. You looked so peaceful.",
        "I don't mind the rain. Sure, I can't watch the planes go by, but I can still listen to the radio chatter. It makes the whole thing a little more mysterious.",
        "I have a backlog of house chores I want to complete today. I've got plenty to keep me busy!",
        "Make sure you stay dry today, dear. I don't want you to become hypothermic.",
        "How was your day, honey? I was going to do the dishes but I got absorbed in the latest issue of \"Knee Surgery Enthusiast\".",
        "If you're enjoying life, who cares if it's a little repetitive? That's what I say.",
        "You look a little soggy, [hun/dear]. Why don't you warm yourself by the fire?",
        "The sound of rain gives our minds something to focus on, so we're not distracted by random thoughts. That's my theory for why it's so soothing...",
        "Hi. It's good to see you. I spent the day skimming through some medical journals.",
        "I made us a nice healthy dinner. Only fresh, wholesome ingredients from the valley! Just make sure to eat a reasonable portion, dear.",
        "I think I'll take a little walk today. I need to unwind.",
        "I had a nice day. It's refreshing to spend some time alone now and then. Did you have a good day, honey?",
        "Hi! I'm just shopping for some essentials, so I can continue to cook healthy meals for us.",
        "I have to go into the clinic today. Have a nice day, okay?",
        "Hi, honey. How was your day? *Phew*... I'm exhausted... My patients are still healthy, so it was a good day.",
        "[Player]...I still can't believe we're married...",
        "You rescued me from a life of loneliness, and filled the emptiness in my heart. Thank you.",
        "I knew you were the one from the moment you moved here.",
        "Be careful out there! I have nightmares about your limp body being wheeled into the emergency room.",
        "This place is my home now... I'm happy here.",
        "Wow, you look really handsome today! Did you shave?",
        "Oh, my... you look beautiful today.",
        "(Farmer's name), we're going to have a baby soon.",
        " I was afraid of you when we first met. It's funny to think about now that we've come so far.",
        "Dear, I filed our adoption papers. Now all we can do is cross our fingers and wait.",
        "(Farmer's name), I hope our adoption request gets approved. I want a baby.",
        "[Term of endearment], can't you tell? You're pregnant.",
        "You and (baby's name) are the most important parts of my life.",
        "Little [child] is going to have the perfect childhood here. We're really fortunate to have this opportunity.",
        "So far, I really like being a father!",
        "Don't worry, I'll feed (baby's name) today. You can just focus on running the farm.",
        "I already gave [child] and [child] their breakfasts. I'm trying to teach them to enjoy healthy food!",
        "I believe a child should be allowed to play and explore to their heart's content. You're only a kid once.",
        "Maybe [child] will grow up to become a pilot, like I never could?",
        "My life is devoted to you and the children now, and I'm very happy about it. I always dreamed of having a wonderful family. I had nightmares of being a bachelor forever.... I love you so much.",
        "Everything went well, and now little (baby's name) is part of the family. We're very fortunate.",
        "Let's plant some healthy vegetables this spring.",
        "It's wonderful to see all the plants return to life. The greenery is refreshing after a monochrome winter.",
        "Oh, it's a festival tomorrow, isn't it? Large crowds, activities... *gulp*",
        "W'Will you dance with me at the festival tomorrow? It's always a little embarrassing.",
        "Make sure you don't get sunburnt, honey... That can really damage your skin.",
        "Make sure you don't get sunburnt, dear! It's very dangerous for your skin. As your husband and doctor, I consider your health and safety my top priority!",
        "Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup? I would put an item of high value and quality. We all want to leave a great impression on the governor!",
        "As summer draws to a close, and the colder season begins, my workload tends to increase. Sorry in advance if I'm a little moody...",
        "I could sure go for some wine.",
        "Make sure and diversify your harvests this fall, my dear. Or just grow cranberries... It's really up to you. What do I know?",
        "Tomorrow's the fair. The food is very rich and salty, but I'm fine with splurging once in a while.",
        "I'll admit, the spirit's eve festival usually gives me intestinal pain... but I'll do my best to be brave.",
        "Winter is flu season, so work is probably going to be a lot more stressful. Sorry in advance if I'm grouchy.",
        "The air is very dry during winter. That's why our skin tends to become irritated. Don't worry, I'll rub a little truffle oil onto your back every night.",
        "Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? I do enjoy the igloos...",
        "Well, here's to a fantastic year. I have complete confidence that next year will be even better!",
        "When I'm next to you, I'm not even scared of falling off this cliff and dashing onto the sharp rocks below... I... I love and admire you very much, [Player]...",
        "I... I can't look at you. Please spare me any more pain."

        "Thats odd... It's just a dead end up ahead.I could've sworn there was someone ahead of me when I went through the maze, though. Where'd they go?",
        "Tonight, after everyone is asleep, that weird old man who lives in the woods will set up the haunted maze. He always makes sure no one is around to see him working.",

        "One time, Gus fell in the river during the Ice Festival. We had to build a huge fire in the saloon to dry him out.We were all worried we'd never taste his famous spaghetti ever again.",

        "There's too much stuff I want to get done today... Maybe I'll just watch TV instead.",
        "The old guitar... I just don't have the drive to play it anymore. That's fine. What's on your agenda today?",
        "Maybe I should get some off-road wheels for my skateboard. Mayor Lewis can't touch me out here.",
        "I always keep an eye on the wide blue sky. You never know when a UFO might go by.",
        "Hi, [Player]! If I knew more about farm work I'd help you out more. Sorry! I'll try and help you with encouraging thoughts.",
        "Something in the air makes me feel positive' maybe it's the faint whiff of pizza from Gus' ovens.",
        "Wow' you look great today, and the specks of mud just add some extra charm.",
        "Hey, look at those puffy clouds in the sky, honey! I'm going to watch those for a while, if you don't mind.",
        "Hey, you look tired. Let me help you relax tonight, okay? Maybe I'll give you a massage later.",
        "My day? Oh' I can hardly remember. I didn't really do anything of note. Just relaxed and had a good time.",
        "Hey, sorry I didn't make the bed. You know I'm sloppy' that's why you like me, right?",
        "The only thing I miss about living at home is Mom's fish casserole.",
        "Ready to hit the hay? I actually made the bed for once'",
        "I wonder if the moon is visible tonight? So, did you get everything done on the farm today? If you didn't I won't be mad!",
        "Might be a good day to sit back and jam on the guitar' Hey, you can relax too if you want.",
        "Do you think Sebastian and Abigail will ever hook up? Heh' now that I'm married I'm trying to get everyone else married too.",
        "Hey, I found one of these rolling around in the back of a drawer. I thought you might be able to use it.",
        "Aw, man. These cloudy days are kind of a drag...",
        "How'd you sleep? The sound of rain really makes me zonk.",
        "I might spend some time today fixing any leaks in the roof or the windows.",
        "Hey, how was your day? I just layed around and read comics most of the day' it was great.",
        "It was a pretty low-key day for me' colas, frozen pizza, a few hours noodling around on the guitar. I feel relaxed.",
        "Earlier, I listened to our live recording from that show we played. Remember that? Man, was that sloppy. It made me a little nervous that you were there, I didn't want to mess up and have you think I was a loser!",
        "I hope Vincent's not too lonely now that I'm gone' I kinda felt responsible for the little guy. But, life's all about change' right? Kids need to learn that, eventually' Or else adulthood will destroy them.",

        "Vincent called. He said he misses me and also to tell you hi.",

        "Don't tell my mom... but I really just came over for a free lunch.",
        "Seeing family is nice, but it's also kind of depressing in a weird way. Like' our lives are totally separate now, and everything feels more formal than it used to.",

        "I'll change [First Child]'s diaper' don't worry about it. You've got enough on your plate.",
        "It's weird, but I really like being a father!",
        "I think we should have another kid. Why stop now?",
        "I woke up early, fed the kids and changed their diapers! We're all set. You can just focus on raking in that sweet money. I'm just kidding' I didn't marry you for the money.",
        "We have to make sure and give [First Child] a lot of attention now that we have [Second Child]. We don't want any jealousy between them.",
        "It's fun to see the babies playing with each other. I think they're going to be very close.",
        "I never thought I'd become such a family man, but I'm really satisfied with what we've built here. Life is going great.",
        "Do you ever think of that night we snuck into my room? I do, often'",
        "You know, I think I had a feeling we'd be together from the very beginning. There's just something special between us.",
        "Be careful out there! I know you go into the caves sometimes' you could be eaten alive in there!",
        "Baby, I was just gonna write you a song on the guitar. But now you're here and I feel relaxed. I mainly feel like playing guitar when I'm lonely.",
        "Baby, talk to me! I'm always interested to hear about your day.",
        "Wow, you look really [handsome/stunning] today! Did you do something with your hair?",
        "*sniff* ... My doze is stubbed up... allergies.",
        "Ub' spring' my doze' allergies.",
        "Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be cool to see Sebastian again.",
        "The gang's just the same as always. Are you having a good time?",
        "Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? I thought I could get out of that now that we're married. Whatever. I guess it's funny in a weird way.",
        "Aw, I gotta put on that dorky suit again? I thought now that we're married... Well, alright.",
        "Summer always makes me want to eat more barbecue.",
        "The pollen count is a little lower in summer, so my nose is really happy.",
        "Have you thought about what you're going to put in the soup? It might be funny to put something nasty. You know, play a prank on the governor! Sorry...",
        "I guess it wouldn't be very nice to put something nasty in the soup...",
        "Summer's great, but I'm ready for fall now. Should we watch the jellies tomorrow night? It's always kind of fun.",
        "I wonder what's going on in the rest of the world? We're really secluded here.",
        "It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.",
        "Hey, tomorrow's the fair. I need to get my old slingshot wrist back in shape...",
        "Sebastian's the same as always. Are you having fun at the festival?",
        "I wonder if Mom will let Vincent enter the haunted maze this year. Probably not... Poor kid. He's gonna have to grow up some day...",
        "Hey, I was wondering when you'd show up!",
        "I've given up on being a musician. I'm a family man now!",
        "The cold air makes my hair gel freeze. It's not very pleasant.",
        "Are we going to stop by the ice festival tomorrow? It might be fun to see everyone again'",
        "Aren't you cold? Are you sure don't you want my jacket?",
        "*yawn*  I'm just here for the gifts and the cookies.",
        "We had a great year, [Player]' it's kind of sad that it's over. We'll just have to make next year even better!",
        "I feel like I've changed a lot from when we first met... you know? ...you might call it 'maturity'... hehe. But I'm at a place, now, where I'm actually really excited about our future together.. Even if that means just doing normal stuff, like... uh... buying groceries and changing diapers... hah...",
        "I'm sorry, [Player]. I don't think I can still be your friend.",
        "I'm trying to come up with a new song for my band, but I'm blanking... Hey.. What do you think my new song should be about?"
    ],
    "Sebastian": [
        "Sebastian is a rebellious loner who lives in his parents' basement. He is Maru's older half-brother, and feels like his sister gets all the attention and adoration, while he is left to rot in the dark. He tends to get deeply absorbed in his work, computer games, comic books, sci-fi novels, and will sometimes spend great lengths of time pursuing these hobbies alone in his room. He can be a bit unfriendly to people he doesn't know. Could a charming new farmer cultivate the wasteland of his heart? Who knows?",
        "Oh, really? I wasn't expecting this. It looks great, though. Thank you.",
        "Uhh... well, I appreciate the thought.",
        "I really love this. How did you know?",
        "Hey, that's a frog egg! I'll see if I can get it to hatch. Thanks!",
        "Is that obsidian? This is exactly what I've been looking for... I'm gonna see if I can shape it into a dagger.",
        "You brought me soup? That's really nice of you.This one brings back a lot of memories...",
        "I really love this. How did you know?Mmm... once you get used to eating raw fish, it becomes really addictive.",
        "Hey, thank you. I'll drink this when the sky gets dark.",
        "Whoa... This egg speaks to me... I'll put it on my desk. Thanks!Hmm... I wonder, if I put this under my pillow, will it hatch? Hehe... only one way to find out.",
        "Thanks, I like this.",
        "...thanks.",
        "What are you trying to say... I need to work out?Well, I'm more of a 'nimble' guy... Maybe I'll read the first half.",
        "...?",
        "...I hate this.",
        "Oh. You just moved in, right? Cool.Out of all the places you could live, you chose Pelican Town?",
        "Um... need something?",
        "If I just disappeared would it really matter?",
        "I was thinking... people are like stones skipping over the water. Eventually we're going to sink.",
        "What am I going to do today? Probably nothing.",
        "Sam is probably my only friend in this town. Well, Abby is nice too, but...Umm.. nevermind.",
        "I snuck into the caves last night and got a nasty cut from a rock crab. Don't tell anyone, okay?",
        "Why does everyone like Maru so much? Sure, she's smart and friendly, but don't they realize it's all just an attention-grabbing scam? Sorry...",
        "Uh... I don't really know you.",
        "What? I didn't hear you... I'm busy thinking about something. What do you want?",
        "You know, I should be doing something productive right now. I just lose focus too fast... Maybe I should drink more coffee?",
        "Hey. Your name is [Player], right?",
        "Having a good weekend? ...nice.",
        "I usually stay inside, but I do go to the beach now and then. Pretty much only when it's raining, though. For some reason, staring off into the bleak horizon makes me feel... I dunno. Like it's worthwhile to keep pushing on, I guess.",
        "Sam is probably my only friend in this town, anymore...",
        "I like your new boots! Your hair looks nice today. Do you want to hang out for a while?",
        "You and Sam are probably my only friends in this town.",
        "Could you picture someone like me living on a farm? It seems ridiculous.",
        "Could you picture me living on a farm? It seems ridiculous, but I have been thinking about it lately.",
        "What's new? I'll be at the saloon tonight destroying Sam at pool again.",
        "Should I let Sam win for once? ...nah.",
        "Everyone is so happy in the sun. I don't get it.",
        "I'm looking forward to the cold, damp season. I feel more at home.",
        "What's the point of going outside? I've already seen it all.",
        "I definitely don't want to go swimming, if that's what you're going to ask. Oh, you just stopped to say hi? Sorry.",
        "The temperature only starts to get comfortable at night. It always seems to stay a little cooler by the lake.",
        "Oh, hey. *yawn*",
        "I hope we're not having mushroom casserole tonight...",
        "I usually only go outside after dark. Does that sound weird to you?",
        "Last night, I saw a group of bats flying around near the lake. I guess maybe they are feeding on the mosquitoes this time of year?",
        "Dammit... I almost forgot. I have to go see Doctor Harvey today.",
        "What are you doing in here? I could've been naked!",
        "Everyone is so happy when it's sunny out... Different people like different things, I guess.",
        "Hey, I'm glad you stopped by. How have you been coping with this heat?",
        "Why am I grinning? I guess I've been unusually happy lately...",
        "So... it's the big harvest season, isn't it?",
        "You're probably making a lot of money on your farm, huh? I guess I should get a job soon...",
        "Pumpkin spice this... pumpkin spice that... man, I do get sick of these seasonal fads.",
        "*yawn*... what time is it? I think I slept too much last night.",
        "My room might be a little less depressing if I had a window...",
        "I was *this* close to moping in bed the entire day. Kinda wish I had, now.",
        "The sun is coming out less and less these days... wonderful.",
        "Are you looking forward to the Spirit's Eve festival? It's probably my favorite.",
        "Who does Demetrius think he is, telling me what to do? He's not even my real father.",
        "I've been reading a book about a farmer. Reminds me a lot of you, actually. Sorry if that creeps you out.",
        "I'm glad you showed up. I was starting to get bored. Now I feel a lot more energetic, believe it or not.",
        "I'm enjoying this gloomy weather... although I have to say, it's a little cold.",
        "Nothing surprises me anymore... nothing makes me laugh. Yeah, I know... I'm being a little dramatic.",
        "Hmm... I don't really have anything to say. I still don't know you very well.",
        "Hey... It's hard to think of new things to talk about, sometimes. Even after you know someone. ...Sorry.",
        "Hey, don't let me stop you from getting your work done. If you aren't busy I don't mind if you stick around.",
        "I wonder what's for dinner tonight... *grumble*",
        "It's fun to live so close to the train tracks. It's a reminder that there's a big world out there.",
        "The frogs aren't very happy in winter. Poor little guys.",
        "I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it. What's his problem?",
        "I was so close to screaming at Mom for throwing away my old comic collection... But something stopped me. Hmm... with age comes wisdom.",
        "I should learn how to cook. That would be useful.",
        "I like winter but I do feel bad for all the cold animals out there. I guess they're used to it, though... like me.",
        "I built a snowgoon but Demetrius made me get rid of it... yet Maru's cute little snowman goes unharmed! Ridiculous.",
        "When I was younger I'd run out to the railroad whenever I heard a train coming. Whatever happened to those days...?",
        "My mom's freaking out, but I'm actually kind of enjoying this. I bet the frogs are going wild out there!",
        "I was hoping this weather would come back. It makes me appreciate the summer a little more.",
        "I liked the boat ride. At one point you couldn't see any land at all..",
        "The beach is nice, but I don't love the crowds.",
        "You think Willy would let me lug a jet ski out here? ...Nah.",
        "...Now, if I were a tropical frog, where would I hide...",
        "I bet this place looks pretty cool in the rain.",
        "It's good to get away from the computer and see the real world sometimes. I forget how nice it can be.",
        "I usually wear black, but in this heat...",
        "I'm ready to get back home.",
        "Um... You're single, right? Just wondering!",
        "...You want to get more serious? I feel the same way.",
        "Don't make fun of me... but I've never been in a relationship like this before.",
        "Don't make fun of me... but I've never really had a girlfriend before.",
        "Hey... you look great. I've been thinking about you all day...",
        "Hey... It's been a year since we started dating, remember? It's been the best year of my life...",
        "You came here to see me?",
        "I was just thinking about you...",
        "If you ever wanted to go swimming... I guess I'd do it.",
        "I dunno where I'd be without you... probably in a ditch somewhere.",
        "Imagine if Sam was as reserved as I am.. we'd hang out and never say a word.",
        "In a couple days I'm going to be living on a farm. I can't believe it. I'm happy, though.",
        "When you showed up in town, I never thought I'd be marrying you some day.",
        "We used to do a rotten egg toss... Mayor Lewis put an end to that pretty quick.",
        "You know what? I kind of miss the winter... it's simpler, in a way.",
        "I'll be rooting for you in the egg hunt.",
        "I'm not too big on festivals. Lots of commotion, too much social interaction... More stress than fun, if you ask me.",
        "Ugh...",
        "I didn't come here by choice.",
        "No... There's someone else I want to dance with.",
        "Ugh... Tomorrow is the worst festival of the year by a mile. Just wait and see how stupid I look during the flower dance.",
        "Hey, I'll just stay here and relax in the shade.You know how I am...I've always been more of a cave dweller.",
        "One year Sam put a pound of anchovies in the potluck soup. Ever wondered why Sam leads the town in community service hours?",
        "I'm doing my best to stay in a good mood...",
        "Hehe... It might be funny to put something disgusting in the potluck soup tomorrow. Just don't poison anyone. Why ruin the potluck? Hmm... I guess some people feel liberated when the rigid structures of society break down a little. Maybe I'm weird.",
        "I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark.Just trying to scare you...",
        "I remember the first Moonlight Jellies Festival that you came to. You didn't notice, but I was watching you when the jellies came up. You looked beautiful in that blue light...",
        "Tomorrow we'll all be gathering at the docks to see the migration of the moonlight jellies. I think it starts at ten o' clock.",
        "It's kinda hectic today... I'm just gonna hang out here for a while.",
        "Hey, [Player]. I'm just catching up with Sam. Go ahead and have some fun.",
        "I have no idea how these skeletons are walking... creepy. It's pretty cool though.",
        "It would be interesting to have one of these on the farm.",
        "Hey, could you... give me a hand? Hehehe...",
        "These gravestones would look nice on the farm, don't you think?",
        "The Spirit's eve festival is tomorrow. I really hope they have those skeletons on display again this year. I almost feel like they're my friends at this point.",
        "Cold? Nah, I never get cold.",
        "Don't worry about me, I never get cold...",
        "I feel more relaxed at night... I might even buy a trinket.",
        "Spending time with family is tiring sometimes.",
        "Hey, [Player]. As you can see, I'm fulfilling my family obligations...",
        "Hey... don't worry, you don't need to get me anything. I'm just happy to wake up next to you every morning... what else could a guy ask for?",
        "It's the eve of the winter star today. Better make sure you've got an empty stomach for the feast tomorrow.",
        "The wedding was wonderful... wasn't it, dear? Well, we can't forget about the farm... time to get to work.",
        "Living here with you is teaching me to come out of my shell a little bit. I think it's good for me.",
        "Hey. How'd you sleep last night? I heard you mumbling. You seemed scared, but I have to admit... it was kind of cute.",
        "I couldn't sleep last night so I went for a night ride on the motorcycle. I need to stay independent, even though we're married. That's just how I am. I still love you, though.",
        "The older I get, the less I'm drawn to the city. It had a certain mystique to it, once. But it turns out that was just a romantic fantasy. The city's so busy, so full of people... I don't belong there. I'm a loner.",
        "Well, this place sure beats my old basement room, doesn't it?",
        "You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.",
        "Hey, do we have any pizza in the freezer? I'm hungry.",
        "I just feel like sleeping today.",
        "Hey...want some coffee? I needed some...woke up early from a nightmare and I just couldn't fall back asleep.",
        "I'm debating whether I should work or just read comics all day. Hey, do we have any pizza in the freezer? I'm hungry.",
        "If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. Don't worry about me.",
        "I feel like I want to do something today... but I'm not sure what. Do you ever have that problem, [Player]?",
        "I'll just watch you from here. I enjoy watching you.",
        "Hm...Sometimes I have to force myself to stay outside for health. I dunno what it is, but I like being indoors. Maybe I'm just so used to my dark basement.",
        "I don't want to get soft now that I'm a married guy. Maybe I should start eating more hot pepper and working out? Just an idea...",
        "We should raise more slimes. In big quantities they can be really profitable. And they're so easy to raise. Also, different color slimes produce different items. I dunno, I think it'd be kind of a fun hobby for us.",
        "This is so different from my old life, but I'm really starting to like it. I feel like I really belong here.",
        "Standing at this spot really makes me want a smoke... but I'm determined to quit now.",
        "I got up early and watered some crops for you. I hope it makes your job a little easier today.",
        "I got up early and fed the farm animals. I also filled [Pet]'s water bowl. I hope this makes your job a little easier today.",
        "I got up early to water some crops and they were already done! You've really got this place under control.",
        "Need something? I'll just be over here working on my bike for a while.",
        "I often felt unappreciated at home...but here I feel like I really belong. Thanks for making me feel welcome, [Player].",
        "It's really cool to have our own place. I can do whatever I feel like and not have people nagging at me all the time. I'm sure Maru's happy that I'm gone.",
        "Hey. I just hung out around the house, today. Nothing interesting... The view from our house is perfect. You can see the sun setting over Pelican Town from the front porch.",
        "Maybe I drank too much coffee... I don't feel very tired. I'm still trying to adjust to the farm schedule. I used to stay up until 5 am and sleep in until 2pm, sometimes.",
        "I spotted a bat out the window earlier. It's kind of hard to see, but if you stay focused you can often catch them flittering about. They're out there.",
        "I may be a reclusive guy, but I'm always happy when you're around.",
        "Hi, [Player]. Good to see you. It's comforting when you're around.",
        "Finally... some heavy rain. I get bored of sunny weather easily.",
        "Hey, another rainy day... perfect. You look cold...here, come closer.",
        "Hey. I was just thinking about my old room in the basement. I felt comfortable there, but this is a lot more interesting. And I don't miss the smell... I felt kind of embarrassed living in my mom's house for so long.",
        "Seems like a pretty good day to just lay around, maybe read a book or something... what do you think?",
        "I got up just before dawn and took a walk around the farm. It's really peaceful at that hour.",
        "Hey. I couldn't sleep last night so I took a walk to the caves. I found this ...want it? I just have trouble sleeping sometimes, it has nothing to do with you. I love you.",
        "I did some work on the laptop today. I was actually brainstorming some ideas for a game I want to make. With your farming income, I can afford to do what I want with my life. It's pretty amazing. Thank you.",
        "How was your day? Did you slay any monsters? It feels good to take out your aggression now and then, doesn't it.",
        "I'm trying my best to quit smoking now that we're married...I don't wanna die on you. It's a bad habit. I want to have a future together.",
        "Maybe a witch will visit us tonight? Hah...if only life was that interesting...",
        "Sorry, I didn't make any dinner. We might have a frozen pizza in the fridge or something. I dunno, my mind was elsewhere. It's hard to remember to do chores...",
        "I'll never grow tired of the rain...especially out here on the countryside.",
        "I'm glad you're home... It's a good night to stay inside.",
        "You could have cleaned up in here a little while I was gone... It's not very nice to have to wade through a bunch of junk after a hard day's work.",
        "Hey. Look at me. Never forget that I love you... you're everything to me. Now go make us some money.",
        "Hey... Come here. You look great today.",
        "You always look great, even after slopping around in the yard all day.",
        "I don't often show it, but I'm really happy that I'm your husband. Marrying you was the best decision I ever made.",
        "You don't ever have to worry about me. I like to spend a lot of time alone.",
        "Sometimes I feel so angry...but when you show up I always start to calm down. Maybe I'll mellow out with age.",
        "I know you're tough, but I still worry about you, sometimes. Don't ever go monster hunting without a life elixir and some sturdy boots, okay?",
        "I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.",
        "I don't really need friends. You're the only person I need in my life. Is that weird? I guess I'm not like most people.",
        "When I take walks I do my best to avoid everyone. I hate being pressured into small talk.",
        "Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...",
        "Are you going in town today? Why? What are you up to?",
        "I guess I can do the laundry today... You probably have your hands full with running the farm.",
        "Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to sell my laptop...",
        "If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I like being alone, anyways.",
        "House-cleaning isn't fun, but when I listen to music and it goes by pretty fast.",
        "Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?",
        "What do you want? You sound like my step-dad. Go away.",
        "This place is starting to feel like a tomb.",
        "I started smoking again... I've just been really stressed out lately.",
        "I'm going to take a walk today. I need some time to myself. I'll see you in the evening.",
        "Mom's face lit up when I walked in. She deserves to be happy.",
        "My day was fine, nothing much to tell you about. Why don't you tell me about yours?",
        "Honey...I wanted to give you that fruit as a symbol of my love.",
        "[Term of endearment], can't you tell? You're pregnant.",
        "[name], we're going to have a baby soon.",
        "Everything went well, and now little <child's name> is part of the family. We're very fortunate.",
        "I'm still getting used to being a father. Don't worry, I'll take good care of <child's name>! It's just... something new.",
        "Maybe when <child's name> is a little older, I'll get a sidecar for the bike and we can all go for a ride.",
        "Have you smelled <child's name>? Maybe it's time for a bath...",
        "Don't worry, I already fed the kids... [child] spilled the chocolate milk all over my shirt again.",
        "I hope <child's name> and [child] are nice to each other. Maru and I always fought as kids. If I think back on it, it was mostly my fault...",
        "I've had this recurring dream that [child] is wearing a shadow shaman costume and sitting on a glowing pumpkin. Weird, huh?",
        "We've come a long way, [Player]. Look at our family. To be honest, I never really thought I'd end up in this situation. Now that I'm here, I like it...",
        "Everything went well, and now little <child's name> is part of the family. We're very fortunate.",
        "Just look at our little family... We've come a long way, haven't we?",
        "Wow, my skin is pale... I guess I'd better help you with some farm work this season.",
        "Now that winter's over, we've got lots of productive weather to look forward to.",
        "Oohh... my head. Happy new year...",
        "Are you excited for tomorrow's festival? It'll be good to see Sam again.",
        "Oh... tomorrow's the flower dance, isn't it? Do we have to go? I hate wearing that ridiculous tight jumpsuit. Why does Lewis make us do this?",
        "Ugh...Yes dear? Ugh...do we have to? Alright.",
        "I'm going to stay inside as much as possible this summer.",
        "Summer's here... I need to start slathering the sunscreen pretty thick if I want to maintain my pale complexion...",
        "Have you thought about what you're going to put in the luau soup? I have no idea what's good... you're the chef!",
        "The weather's starting to cool off. It feels great. Should we go to the festival tomorrow night? It's actually a tradition I kind of enjoy.",
        "My mother used to always make this delicious pumpkin soup in the fall.",
        "Winter's just around the corner. We need to double-check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house. Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.",
        "It seems like the whole valley's changed overnight... I guess fall's finally here.",
        "The Stardew Valley Fair is a little crowded for my tastes... but I'll just hang out with Sam. It'll be good to catch up with him. You should play some carnival games, though! Don't worry about me.",
        "I'm excited for the Spirit's Eve tomorrow. I wonder what horrors we'll find there.",
        "I wonder what Sam's up to? We used to be really good friends.",
        "What are your plans this winter? I know it's more of a laid-back time for you.",
        "Are you going to enter the fishing contest tomorrow?",
        "It's the eve of the winter star today. Better make sure you've got an empty stomach for the feast tomorrow.",
        "It's been a great year, [Player]. We should celebrate a little.  I'm sure next year will be even better.",
        "Before I met you, I spent most of my time turned away from reality... because I thought I'd never find happiness. ...but you've shown me that the world isn't such a dark place, after all. ...That's one of the reasons I love you...",
        "Why do you keep bothering me? I'm trying to forget about you.",
        "*yawn*... I was up until 3 reading this new book... Do you read, (Name)?",
        "*sigh*... If gas wasn't so expensive I'd ride my motorcycle to the city today.  So what do you do when you aren't working?"

        "I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain. If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course.",
        "Oh, is it my birthday? I was hoping I'd forget.This is actually really nice, though. Thank you.",
        "Oh, is it my birthday? That's right... I almost forgot. Thanks.",
        "For my birthday? Thanks.",
        "It's my birthday and you give me this? Is this some kind of joke?",
        "Oh wow, (Name)! How'd you know this is my favorite?",
        "Heh... thanks. Tastes just like beer.",
        "This is great! Thanks!",
        "Oh, you got me something? Thanks!",
        "Oh, you made it? *squish*' Um' *smack*' I think I'll stick to frozen pizza. But thanks.",
        "I don't really like this.",
        "Why are you giving me your garbage?",
        "I don't know you. Why are you talking to me?",
        "I hardly know you. Why are you talking to me?",
        "What? What do you want? Go away.",
        "No, I don't have time to chat with you.",
        "What do you want from me? Money? I'd give you a pot of gold to leave me alone!",
        "What do you want? Leave me alone.",
        "Don't you have work to do?",
        "Why are you bothering me? I want to be alone.",
        "I'm busy, can't you tell?",
        "You again? How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone?",
        "I'm surprised that you're still trying to make friends with me. Haven't I been rude enough to you yet? *sigh*...",
        "You're really persistent. I guess I'm just surprised that anyone would be interested in talking to me.",
        "Hey. Sorry if I came off as rude when we first met. It takes me a while to warm up to strangers.",
        "Hmm... it's [current time]. Should I throw a frozen pizza in the microwave, or should I wait?",
        "Every time I try something new it goes horribly wrong. You learn to just stay in a shell.",
        "...Every day is the same. Stocking those horrible shelves, going to the saloon, tossing and turning all night.",
        "What's the point of life if all you do is work?",
        "I'm renting my room from Marnie at a really good price. It's small but I can't complain.",
        "I hated my job at JojaMart, but now that I'm unemployed I feel even worse.",
        "I haven't been able to pay my rent, but Marnie's letting me stay anyway. I'm lucky.",
        "If I could reset my life maybe I'd start a chicken farm. Only free-range eggs of course.",
        "I heard you built Pam a house... That's really generous... You know, I could use a hundred thousand gold myself... *ahem* ...ah ...Just kidding. ...Heh.",
        "I heard someone bought Pam a house... *sigh*... What did Pam ever do to earn that kind of generosity??",
        "Life isn't so bad... at least I have frozen pizza and eggs.",
        "Buh... Where's the Joja Cola?",
        "I'll definitely be going to the saloon tonight. What else is there to do?",
        "...I think I might be gaining weight.",
        "I guess I've grown attached to Marnie and Jas. We're a ragtag bunch but it kind of feels like a weird family. I never really had much of a family as a kid.",
        "You like talking to me? I guess I believe you... maybe you're as weird as I am.",
        "I've really grown attached to Marnie's chickens.",
        "If I watch more TV maybe I can forget about life. That would be relaxing.",
        "I don't have to go into work today, so I'm not complaining...",
        "Oh, there's some kind of weird weather today? I didn't notice.",
        "Buh... hope the bar's open.",
        "That's right... I'm not wearing any shoes or socks. Some call it a public health risk. The crabs seem to enjoy it, though.",
        "Okay, this sand is piping hot. I regret not wearing shoes.",
        "Hoo... Feels good to rest these hams. If anyone needs me, I'll just be sitting here, marinating.",
        "Phew... feels good to have a cold drink... Or maybe a few...",
        "Welp... got my year's supply of Vitamin D. Now I can play video games with the blinds shut the rest of the year.",
        "...!! I'll accept this. Thank you.",
        "Do you ever feel like the whole world is scrutinizing you like some disgusting insect?",
        "Hi, [Player]. I've actually been having a pretty good day so far.",
        "...!!! I accept!! ... I'll set everything up. We'll have the ceremony in 3 days, okay?",
        "Part of me is wondering if this isn't all some elaborate prank. I can't believe you'd actually want to marry someone like me.",
        "[Player]... My head's spinning, and I haven't even had a beer yet.",
        "(Shane has a glazed look in his eye. He won't speak to you.)",
        "I don't understand you... *sigh*...",
        "Hey, stop that! ... Yuck!",
        "Our hens have been working overtime to prepare for this festival. They deserve the best tonight... bowls full of sweet yellow corn!",
        "Some of these eggs were laid just this morning. See? They're still warm!",
        "I came here once when I was a kid...The only thing I remember is getting sick on the bus ride.  ",
        "Mmm... excellent sauce. *slurp* Ah, this green stuff is spicy! *munch* *crunch* ...ow.",
        "I couldn't find any clean shirts so this one has to do.",
        "Um... sure. / I'd better stop eating...",
        "Dance? Hoo-boy. Okay... let me chug a few more of these first...",
        "...No.",
        "Wow... you don't get hot pepper chutney like this in the big city...",
        "The jellies were here a year ago, and they'll be back a year from now... Nature is amazing.",
        "All these animals are friendly and love to get massaged.",
        "Why is there no more pumpkin ale?",
        "If it was up to me, I'd probably have a pizza festival at the saloon, instead...",
        "I'm taking a night off from the saloon for Jas' sake...",
        "I've met some people who believe in spirits, and magic... but me? I've never seen anything that couldn't be explained by science.",
        "Buh... sometimes life feels like a slow, gray blur... know what I mean?",
        "Do me a favor... when I pass away, use my dust to fertilize some corn for the hens.",
        "*smooch*... Mmm, it tastes like someone's been nibbling on pizza rolls.",
        "I may keep to myself a lot, and I may seem unhappy sometimes... but I do appreciate all the work you do. I'm a lucky guy.",
        "There's something special in the air... *sniff*... what is that? Oh... It's just this old corn chip I put in my pocket a few weeks ago. *crunch*",
        "Beer or cider? Sometimes life can be challenging.",
        "Hi, [Player]. I'll just hang out in here today and uh... maybe sweep the floor a little bit or something.",
        "Hey. Take this... I put a bit too much in the microwave. Sorry if it's squishy.",
        "What do you think, [random term of endearment]?  I figured the room could use a little more decoration.",
        "What do you think, [random term of endearment]?  I ordered this the other day and it just arrived.",
        "What do you think of the new wallpaper I chose?",
        "What do you think of the new flooring I chose?",
        "I didn't sleep well last night so I'm hoping this fresh air will help get the juices flowing. What juices, you ask? Heh... you're weird.",
        "Sometimes I stop and realize that I'm nothing more than a bag of juicy, squishy flesh. But hey... that's just fine... what's life, anyway?",
        "When I stop and think about it... I'm in a good place. My life is pretty nice.",
        "Ooohh... my tongue is swollen from eating too many pepper poppers.",
        "I dunno if my lungs can handle this freshness. I'm still used to JojaAir.",
        "Hey, [Player]. You were sleeping like a baby so I slipped out of bed and went for a morning walk around the farm. Everything looks fine.",
        "I got up early to water some crops and they were already done! You've really got this place under control.",
        "I got up early and fed all the farm animals. I hope that makes your job a little easier today. I also filled <pet's name> water bowl.",
        "I spent the morning repairing a few of the fences. They should be as good as new.",
        "Charlie's doing well.",
        "Don't worry, this is only Joja Cola.",
        "I'm just gonna have a couple more beers before closing my eyes for the night.",
        "If... If only... ah, I was just thinking back on the glory days, when I played gridball on the varsity team. Now I'm old and weak, though...",
        "Ughh... *gurgle*... I feel a little bloated... oof... too much Joja all-purpose dipping sauce.",
        "Buh... I wish I was six inches taller and a whole lot smarter... You like me for who I am? I still have a hard time understanding that...",
        "I spent all day watching TV and now my legs feel like soft dough. Guess I'll have to take it easy until tomorrow.",
        "How was your day? Mine actually went pretty well.",
        "I hope Jas and Marnie are doing alright without me. I'm not too worried... Jas is old enough now to take care of the animals on her own.",
        "You know what? I think I've lost some weight since moving in with you.",
        "Buhh... I don't feel like being productive today.",
        "[Player], should I do something useful today?... or just nap forever?",
        "The roof's leaking? Ah well... a little mold never hurt anyone.",
        "Here... take this. I bought some of those a while ago and they're almost expired...",
        "Hmm... seems like a good night to microwave a few pizza rolls. Some people like to cook them in the oven, but it just takes too long for me. Plus I like that squishy texture.",
        "The tip-tappa-tip of the rain takes me to a different time... a different place.",
        "I guess... if I had some pants I might've gone outside today... but, nah.",
        "I like gloomy weather, but I feel kinda bad for the hens.",
        "Tip-tappa-tip-tappa-tip... I'm starting to feel thirsty.",
        "I just got off the phone with Jas and Marnie. They seem to be having a pretty good time without me.",
        "I'm glad you're home... It's a good night to stay inside.",
        "Honey... I wanted to give you that fruit as a symbol of my love.",
        "*Sniff*... *sniff*... mmm... what's that wonderful fragrance you're wearing? Eau de pepperoni?",
        "You're a lot better-looking than me, you know that?",
        "The name 'Shane' means 'Gift from Yoba'... What a joke.",
        "I'm in a great mood today... The Tunnelers won big last night.",
        "Hey, if I ever seem cranky, just ignore it. I get in weird moods sometimes, but it's not about you... okay?",
        "Ah...life on the farm sure beats working at Joja. That place was disgusting. You thought it was depressing out front? Kid, you should see the backroom...",
        "Ah... this is the life. No responsibilities, Tunnelers game tonight, fridge stocked with all the goodies a guy could need.",
        "I don't really feel like doing work today. Maybe I'll see what's on TV.",
        "Huh... You're wondering why I have this goofy grin on my face? You really have a short memory span, don't you? *blush*",
        "\"[Player]? I just want to say that I appreciate all the hard work you do for our household.",
        "Oh, do you need something from me? Sorry, I'm kind of busy at the moment.",
        "Why don't you tell me about your day when we're in bed tonight? I'm kind of busy right now...",
        "Working at Joja was a drag, but at least I got to interact with people occasionally.",
        "What, you want me to clean the dishes? I'll do it... eventually...",
        "Are we doing okay on money? I don't want to have to go back to working at Joja.",
        "If you need to go see your friends in town, go ahead. I'm happy in the company of the TV and a couple of tall boys.",
        "Ugh... clean, clean, clean. Sweep, sweep, sweep. Bathe. Cook. Make the bed... Oh, well. Life's alright.",
        "I wonder if we'll live here our entire lives?",
        "Look, I just want to be alone. Why don't you go outside and do your own thing for a while?",
        "What do you want? You sound like Marnie on one of her bad days. Go away.",
        "Farm-life is actually really boring. What am I doing here?",
        "Yeah... *hic* ... Sure, honey. Whatever you say... *hic*",
        "*grumble*... chores...",
        "What... you want me to clean? Make you a sandwich? *sigh*...",
        "*sigh*... I just want to stay in bed.",
        "I just don't feel like getting up today.",
        "Nnnghh...what is it? Make your own breakfast.",
        "Nghh... what is it? I'm trying to sleep.",
        "So...I heard you secretly gave [CharacterName] a gift today...Do I have to be suspicious of you?",
        "I'm going out today, alright?",
        "I'm attached to these woods... lots of memories...",
        "If I don't order a cold one now and then, Gus will go out of business. I'm just doing my civic duty. I'll head home around 10.",
        "I'll just play one more round...",
        "Oh, hey [Player]. Miss me already?",
        "Hmm... I have to say, JojaMart has a much better selection of frozen dinners.",
        "Sorry if I'm sweaty... That was quite a walk... Buh, I'm out of shape.",
        "It's not very nice to have to wade through a bunch of junk after a hard day's work.You could have cleaned up in here a little while I was gone...",
        "[Term of endearment], can't you tell? You're pregnant.",
        "<spouse name>... I hope our adoption request gets approved. I want a baby.",
        "Hun, I filed our adoption papers. Now all we can do is cross our fingers and wait.",
        "It's weird, when I was younger I swore I'd never have a kid. I wonder what happened to me?",
        "Let's make sure to give [child #1] lots of eggs... Baby's gotta grow those legs!",
        "Papa Shane reporting for duty... Buh... I've become corny in my old age.",
        "Two beautiful children...We've come a long way, haven't we?",
        "I already fed the kids two bowls of pizza puffs cereal. They'll be full for a while.",
        "I'll be honest... two kids is enough for me.",
        "Ugh... [child #2] is being a little brat today. Must've gotten that from me...",
        "*Sigh*... If only we could send the kids off to Joja work-camp for a season... I'm just kidding.",
        "Maybe I'll learn a new skill this year...",
        "Ooo... my throbbing head. How many did I have last night?",
        "Now that winter's over, we've got lots of productive weather to look forward to.",
        "The egg festival is probably my favorite... you know how I am, I go crazy for anything to do with chickens.",
        "Oh, right. It's the flower dance tomorrow. Hey, if it makes you happy, I'm happy.",
        "What's on my agenda today... hmmm...  I think I see some spicy pretzel snacks and a couple of 'cold boys' on the horizon.",
        "Sorry if I smell... I was sweating all night in the heat.",
        "It's summer... that means the house is full of flies... Don't worry. I'll take care of them.",
        "I like seeing all the tropical plants this time of year. The valley gets so lush.",
        "I might fast until the luau tomorrow. I need the ol' bag to be empty so I can fill it with piping hot soup.",
        "What are your plans for the fall? I'm going to try and incorporate more wine into my diet.",
        "I think there might be a new species of fungus growing behind my mini-fridge. Ah well, 'tis the season, right?",
        "Winter's just around the corner. We need to double check the heating system, turn off the valves, and check all the insulation in the house.Don't worry, I'll take care of it all.",
        "Hmm... I might have to buy a few cases of pumpkin ale to celebrate the season...",
        "I'll be helping Marnie with the animals at tomorrow's fair, like usual. You should just kick back and have some fun.",
        "I'm starting to really feel my age... and I'm not comfortable with that at all.",
        "There's a wide, wide world out there... but I'd rather stay in my room.",
        "Any big plans this winter? I'll probably end up watching a lot of TV and just hanging out around the house.",
        "Well, another year gone by... I look a little older, but that's about all.",
        "Oh, you want to see a show, huh? Buy me a snack and it's a deal, hehe...",
        "You were gone so long I started to get worried about you! I started crying when I saw your limp body.",
        "Ow! I can't believe you would do that to me!",
        "Hey, [Player]. Great view, huh? I was just thinking about the last [N] years... We've been through a lot together, haven't we? ...But look how far we've come. If I hadn't met you, [Player]... I might not even be here right now. Which would be a shame, because the bird-watching up here is phenomenal! Heh... I... I tend to joke a lot, because...well... I guess keeping things light-hearted makes it so I don't have to open up and make myself vulnerable. But every season that goes by, with you, I get a little more comfortable with myself. Uh.. I guess what I want to say is... I have no regrets marrying you!",
        "......Leave me alone."
