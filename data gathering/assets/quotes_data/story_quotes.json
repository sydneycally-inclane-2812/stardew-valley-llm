        "For me? This is such a thoughtful gift! Thank you!",
        "Oh, you've been foraging! Thank you!I'll make a spicy cocktail sauce with this. That'll put some hair on Pierre's chest.",
        "Oh, that's sweet. Thank you.",

        "Um... I guess I could use it for compost...",
        "Hello! You must be [Player], the new farmer. I'm Caroline. My husband runs the general store here. And have you met my daughter, Abigail? She's the pale one with the purple hair.",
        "I wish Abby wouldn't spend so much time in her room.",
        "I've seen wild horseradish in the forest. Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food.",
        "Hi there. Do you have everything you need for the farm? If not, we might be able to help you out. We carry a variety of useful items.",
        "Hmmm... I wonder if I can get Pierre to cook dinner tonight.",
        "Hmmm... what am I going to make for dinner tonight? Maybe I'll just get take-out from the Saloon.",
        "It's a fine-looking day. On days like this I like to help Evelyn with the public gardens. She's strong for her age, but I think she appreciates all the help she can get.",
        "Is it just me, or does Abigail have an unhealthy interest in doom and gloom? Maybe I'm just too old to understand.",
        "Abby's always had a strange interest in the occult. I'm not sure where she gets it from...",
        "Today I'm just going to relax and think positively. Do you ever take a day off?",
        "Oh, [Player]... This is embarrassing. I threw one of your [items] you sold us into my compost bin. Now the whole thing smells horrendous. Where did you find that thing again?",
        "Oh, [Player]... This is embarrassing. I threw one of your [items] you sold us into my compost bin. But on the bright side, the worms are really loving it! They've never looked happier!",
        "Hi, [Player]. Are you enjoying the married life? I hope so!",
        "Dinner's been a lot quieter since Abigail moved out... No, not because she used to chew with her mouth open!",
        "How's Abigail's health? She's always been such a pale girl. Hopefully the farm lifestyle puts a little color in her cheeks.",
        "Abby was taking online classes here, but I don't think her heart was really in it... She's a free spirit, like I was before I met Pierre. She's probably having the time of her life on your farm.",
        "When we first moved here, I took a while to settle down... I wasn't ready for the domestic life. Pierre's a bit traditional... but he's a good man. He's ambitious, but he always puts his family first.",

        "Time seems to go by faster and faster the older you get...",
        "You know, I used to want to be a farmer myself. Well, more like a rancher. I always loved movies about the wild west when I was a girl.",
        "Are you excited for the new year? I predict that you'll be super-successful on your farm.",
        "When we first moved to Pelican Town I would take secret walks to the Wizard's Tower. Don't tell Pierre, he has jealousy issues. Abigail was born about a year after we moved to Pelican Town. I wonder if she'll ever experience life outside the valley?",
        "On Wednesdays the shop is closed. Keep that in mind if you're going to need anything.",

        "Ah, the special rain is back! This year, I'm going to make the most of it! This calls for a cup of green tea!",
        "Fall is Abby's favorite season, so I'm hoping she'll come out of her room more often.",
        "I've seen edible mushrooms in the forest. Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food.",
        "Is it just me, or does Abigail play too many video games? Maybe I'm a little old-fashioned.",
        "It's my annual check-up today. At least I don't have to walk very far.",
        "You're here to see the doctor too? What happened?",
        "Excuse me, I have to say some things to Doctor Harvey in private...",
        "Winter is harsh, but you can dig up some roots if you're lucky. Foraging can be a fun way to earn some cash. Or you can use what you find as gifts or food.",
        "Even though it's cold, I still check on the public garden beds every now and then. I just want to make sure they aren't damaged too much before spring returns.",
        "Don't you think Abby would look better with her natural hair color? She used to have light chestnut-colored hair.",
        "Hmm... Should I wear something special to the aerobics meet-up today?",
        "Don't look! I'm all red and sweaty.",
        "You're looking really fit, Jodi! Those dumbbells do wonders, don't they?",
        "Mmff... I think I've earned some cookies today. *crunch*.",
        "Finally... A little time to myself.",
        "It was the previous owners who built the altar room. We aren't religious, but we let the other townsfolk use it if they want.",
        "Willy gave us each a piece of his fish jerky. I'm still chewing on it.",
        "The water is so warm here compared to the valley. It's really pleasant!",
        "I told Gus to surprise me, and he made an iced green tea with mango zest. How nice!",
        "Hi [Player]. Are you here to relax, or to do work?",
        "I'll sleep well tonight!",
        "Abby's always loved the egg hunt, ever since she was a tiny girl.",
        "It may be a little boring, but these festivals are a good chance to connect with our neighbors.",
        "This weather is just perfect. I can't tell where my skin ends and the air begins.",
        "I wish Pierre would spend this time with the family...",
        "Pierre is very serious about his grange display. He's been setting aside the best-looking produce for weeks in preparation. Hey, best of luck to you if you enter!",
        "I get scared very easily. I'll leave the haunted maze to the younger people.",
        "How's winter coming along for you, [Player]?",
        "I'm getting all my holiday shopping done tonight! Let me know if you see Pierre coming...",

        "Business has been slow lately. You should upgrade your tools. I could use the cash.",
        "The weather doesn't really matter to me. I typically stay near my shop year-round. Depressing, huh?",
        "Sometimes I wonder how I ended up in this town.",
        "Don't you have work to do?",
        "So how are your tools holding up?",
        "...I found you unconscious in the mines. I think I blew my back out, dragging you all the way up here. Be a little more careful next time, okay?",
        "Oh, hi [Player]. Sorry If I look a little messy. I've been working at the furnace all morning. So, did you need anything, or do you just want to visit?",
        "Damn it, I'm too old to do anything exciting anymore. All I have to look forward to is years and years of sweaty, hot furnace-work.",
        "I should save up and buy a computer.Maybe I can find a girlfriend on the 'internet'...What? Don't judge me! Not everyone is a cool, attractive, socially-adept farmer, you know!What's a guy like me supposed to do? *Groan*",

        "It's situations like this where a person's true character is put to the test. I'll keep Em... I mean, I'll keep everyone safe from the toxic rain!",
        "I feel bad admitting it, but sometimes I wish there was a real disaster, not just some dumb green rain. Something to shake everything up, you know? Not that I want people to get hurt... I just want to feel alive... To feel like I have a purpose...",
        "Well that was a dud. And here I thought it was finally my chance to be a hero. Oh well... Back to the grindstone.",

        "Oh no... *gulp*... It's mostly salad this year...",
        "Hey, [Player]. To tell you the truth, I don't really like festivals. But I'd feel even worse if I stayed at home, knowing everyone else was out here having fun.",
        "Need any ores?",
        "I wonder if Emily would dance with me?",
        "*sigh* Everyone is partnered up... and here I am alone, once again'Ah well... I'll just drown my sorrows with some of that sweet and tangy jelly.",

        "It's a good season to start thinking about gardening, even for us non-farmers.  The valley is known for producing some of the finest spring flowers!",
        "Have you planted any spring crops yet? The season doesn't last forever, you know.",
        "Hmm... tax collection... *mumble* ...spring festivities expenses... *mumble*... Yes?",
        "Ah... There's nothing like a strong cup of tea in the morning.",
        "Gardening is a hobby of mine, so I'm excited for this warm weather.",
        "Ah, my flowers are growing wonderfully!",
        "Good morning! Can you smell the sweet scent of these dew-lilies?",
        "It's early but the air is already quite warm. Summer is nice for an old guy like me hehe.",
        "How did I become Mayor in the first place? It's a long story. We're both too busy for stories right now.",
        "The moonlight jellies will be here soon. It's one of my favorite things about the valley.",
        "The saloon gets pretty lively at night. I like to visit once a week or so to catch up on things. And to get a taste of Gus' authentic spaghetti.",
        "Hmm... I wonder if it's anyone's birthday today? I'd better check the calendar by Pierre's shop.",
        "Say, are you growing any blueberries on your farm? I do enjoy a fresh blueberry.",
        "I just got off the phone with the Governor... Apparently this rain is supposed to be completely harmless. Just an unusual phenomenon of nature. Still, some of the townsfolk are panicking, which is never good...",
        "I guess we can expect these unusual rains every year. I think everyone is a little calmer knowing that it's just part of nature.",
        "Well, that was quite the excitement for our little town! I'm just relieved that everyone is okay. If this ever happens again, I think we'll all be a little more relaxed. It's not the end of the world!",
        "Some of the townsfolk are wary of strangers. You'll have to win their trust before they open up to you. Just be persistent and you'll get through to them.",
        "It was around this time of year when I first became Mayor, over twenty years ago. That makes me feel really old.",
        "If you have any suggestions for the town, just drop a note into my suggestion box. Oh, that's right... I don't have a suggestion box.",
        "Every Wednesday I have buckwheat waffles and coffee for breakfast. It's a little tradition I keep to keep the bachelor life interesting.",
        "Hmmm... these strange little mushrooms have been popping up in my wood chips. I wonder what kind they are?",
        "Good morning! We're slowly entering the cold months, so I'm seeing my garden to a gentle end.",
        "I hope things are going well for you on the farm.",
        "Do you have any bee houses on your farm? If you place them near flowers you can get different types of honey.",
        "Sometimes you can tell if there's something buried underground. Just keep your eyes open.",
        "Have you tried Gus' 'secret' spaghetti sauce? ...The ingredients may be secret, but the smell isn't. I'll see you later.",
        "Are you doing your best on the farm, [Player]? You'll have to accomplish things in many areas if you want to become a well-rounded citizen.",
        "Well, winter is here! That means the townspeople will be spending most of their days indoors. At least you'll know where to find them!",
        "Another year is almost over! I hope you had a productive year!",
        "I've got to start coming up with a plan for improving our town next year!",
        "I'll still come by every night to collect your produce, even in the snow. You still need to make money in the winter!",
        "I hope things are going well for you on the farm.",
        "Hi there, [Player]! How're you doing today? If you see Marnie, tell her I say 'hi'.",
        "I've never been married. I have no family. All I live for is to be Mayor. Is it worth it? ...*sigh*...",
        "I'm impressed, [Player]. You've really fixed up the place!",
        "Vacation opportunities like this could really expand the local economy! I'd better not stay in the sun too long, or my moustache will dry out.",
        "Hehe... look at this place! I don't know how you did it, but this little vacation spot is the talk of the town.",
        "Hehe... Gus is really in his element.",
        "Everyone aboard! We're heading back to the valley!",
        "Enjoying yourself, [Player]?",
        "After a long, dark winter, this festival is a good way to revive everyone.",
        "All of this is possible because you fixed up the bus, [Player]. I can't thank you enough!",
        "Remember, today is the last day of the festival. We'll be back next year though.",
        "If you'd like to dance with the other young people, you'll need to find a partner.",
        "Look sharp! The governor's here for his annual visit. If you brought something for the potluck make sure and add it to the soup cauldron.",
        "Good evening, [Player]. The Moonlight Jellies are close... I already saw one glowing in the distance. Once we launch the candle-boat they'll come up to the docks and say hello.",
        "Well [Player], It's the big day... Our most important festival of the year, the 'Stardew Valley Fair'. If you'd like to participate by setting up a grange display, I've left an empty stand for you. Just let me know after you've set everything up so we can get to the judging.",
        "Good evening, [Player]. Have you ventured into the haunted maze yet? It's quite spooky. That strange man who lives in the tower set it all up himself. He wouldn't let anyone near while he was working on it.",
        "Welcome to the Festival of Ice! The highlight of today's festival is the ice fishing competition. We set up this 'frozen lake' and stocked it full of fish. Just let me know when you're ready to compete.",
        "You know, I've purchased some of my favorite items from this market...",
        "Today is a time to be thankful for this year's good fortune. Forget your worries for a day and relax!"

        "I have everything I need to survive, and more. Nature plays a wonderful tune if you can only learn to listen. I also spend a lot of time reading. One of the reasons I stopped in the valley was for the great library.",

        "Winter is tough, but you can still fish and forage to get by. If you have any animals you should keep them inside.",
        "The trees go to sleep during the winter. It makes it a bit lonely out here. But I wouldn't deny them their beauty sleep.",

        "By the stem o' me pipe...  a cup o' Stardrop Tea! And here I thought it was only the stuff of mermaid legend. Thank you kindly.",
        "Aye...  A timeless classic. Brings a tear to me eye, with every read. A fisherman can never have too many copies! Thank ye.",
        "This looks great. Thank you!",
        "Ah, 'Bait And Bobber'... Every angler ought to have a subscription, but it costs a pretty penny. Taught me a lot of good fishin' tips over the years. Thanks!",
        "Ah, this stuff warms the ol' bones. Thank you.",
        "A gift! Thanks.",
        "The horror! ...What kind of monster is this?",
        "Hmmm... You like stuff like this? Huh.",
        "Ah, this stuff warms the ol' bones. Thank you.",
        "... *sniff*... Well I guess I can toss it into the chum bucket.",
        "Ahoy there! It's nice to see young folk movin' in to the valley. It's not very common these days.",
        "Ahoy there, [son/lass]. Looks like decent weather for fishing, eh?",
        "Have you had much luck in the local waters? You look like you could be a strong angler if you set your mind to it.",
        "A true angler has respect for the water... don't you forget that.",
        "Some fish come and go with the seasons. Others only come out at night or in the rain.",
        "*mumble* *mumble* ...Eh? I would tell you about my thoughts, but it's a fisherman's secret",
        " There are rumors of some very rare fish in these parts... but only an experienced angler could stand a chance against them. You'll need the finest bait you can get if you want a rare fish to bite.",
        "If you really want to get the fish biting, make sure you put some bait on your hook.",
        "If the local fishing scene got a bit more lively, I might expand the shop's stock.",
        "If you purchase a high quality fishing rod, you'll be able to attach bait and tackle to the line. Bait causes fish to bite faster. Tackle can make your job a lot easier when reeling fish in. There are all kinds of tackle, with different perks. They're usually a little flimsy, so don't be surprised if your tackle breaks after a while.",
        "I'm a simple man...when my pipe is full, I'm happy. When my pipe is empty...well, then I just fill 'er up again.",
        "The ol' Man was a fisherman, you know. I grew up sailing between the fern islands, living from catch to catch. The fishing life is tough, but there's something about it that keeps you goin'.",
        "How's the fishing life going for ya? I try to fish as often as possible, but it's not easy when you've got a shop to run.",
        "Hey, it's my skipper, [Player]! I'd give you a discount on bait if I could afford it.",
        "Aye... I hope these weird rains don't bother the fish... It could ruin me life!",
        "If the fish like these rains, then I like 'em, too.",
        "Well, the fish seem as healthy as ever. In fact, I swear they've been biting with extra vigor!",
        "Tomorrow is the annual Trout Derby... Aye, it's a freshwater enthusiast's dream! Anglers from all over the world will be here to catch our beautiful Rainbow Trout... [I'd better see you out there, lad!/I hope to see you out there!] For the next two days, I'll only be manning the shop for one hour, starting at 9am. So if you really need somethin', you can come by then.",
        "Tomorrow, at the beach, is the start of a little gathering... called 'SquidFest'. Aye... tis' a difficult catch, the squid. But I trust that you've developed a knack for the sport, by now.",
        "Giving up the [bachelor/single] life, eh? Just don't forget to make time for fishing...",
        "Ah, you caught the Angler, did ya? A good 'first step' into the world o' rare fish, that one.",
        "So, you finally conquered the Crimsonfish! That fish has been taunting me for many years. He nearly nibbled through the wood under me house!",
        "By the stem o' me pipe... You actually caught 'the Legend'. I never thought I'd see the day... Well, [lad/miss], you've done it... You're the best [fisherman/angler] this valley's seen in a long time...",
        "Ah, so you finally snagged the Glacierfish... That's one of the slipperiest fish I've ever encountered! How many tries did it take ya?",
        "*sniff* *sniff*... Something tells me you've been fishin' in the sewers, [lad/miss]. It's an unconventional approach, to be sure. There's legend of gargantuan carp, twisted into monsters from the toxic sludge...",
        "*sniff*... Ah... That old familiar scent. You've been raisin' crabs, haven't ya? Yer a [man/lady] after me own heart, [Player]. Hah! Here, take this. I found it on the beach... Been savin' it fer a special occasion. It's not every day I discover a fellow crab enthusiast!",
        "Sometimes I'll hide an egg too well and no one finds it... Well, until summer rolls around. Then the hot air starts to bring out the rotten smell... Hehe.",
        "Aye... on rainy days, you'll find catfish in these waters. They're a challenging catch, but well worth the effort!",
        "Have you had much luck in the local waters? You look like you could be a strong angler if you set your mind to it.",
        "I should've brought my fishing pole.",
        "Hi there, [Player]. Taking a breather? To tell you the truth, I'd rather be fishing right now.",
        "It's the big day! I've got all me equipment tuned to catch Trout... Good luck out there!",
        "How's the derby treatin' ya so far? I've found plenty o' Golden Tags, meself... but it's not over yet!",
        "Most night-fish would be scared of the light... these are strange ones.",
        "Are you setting up a grange display, [Player]? It's your chance to show off all the good produce from [farm name]!",
        "Hey, [Player]. Ready for some ice fishing?",
        "Don't give up just yet! There's more squid in these waters...",
        "It warms me ol' winter heart to see all these anglers gathered here, all for the love o' fishing...",
        "I can't get me a good night's sleep with that night market going on... eh, but that's okay. I'm flexible.",
        "Have you been on the deep-sea submarine? The captain's an old friend.",
        "Ah, nothin' like a hot beverage to wind down after a cold, dark day...",
        "Do you want to hear the Legend of the Winter Star?"

        "Ughh... These are utterly mundane. Please refrain from bothering me with this in the future.",
        "Ah, yes. I have predicted your arrival a long time ago, young [Player]. However, your fate is ultimately in your own hands.",
        "Ah, yes. I have seen many things about your future, young [Player]. If I were to tell you, there could be grave consequences.",

        "I believe the townsfolk are afraid of me. It is unfortunate, but I suppose it is human to be afraid of the unknown.",
