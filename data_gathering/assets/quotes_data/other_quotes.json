People like us have a responsiblity [sic] to keep the world alive, to give folks a taste of the extraordinary. You see, kid... The world's like a bowl of rice. It's got substance, but it ain't worth nothin' without a good, zesty sauce. That's where we come in. Didn't you ever wonder who put those treasure chests in the old mineshaft? I like to give people surprises. You'll understand someday. Just keep doing your best and never give up.",

Even though you only needed a fraction of the walnuts to gain full access to the island, you decided to push yourself further. Your desire to enter this secret door was so strong, that you went above and beyond to get inside. That drive is what sets you apart, kid. You've got a very special energy. That being said... You weren't under the impression that the challenge ended here, were you? No... Hah. Hah. Hah... In fact, the challenge has just begun. On your left, you'll find a board with some very interesting opportunities. These challenges, which I've designed just for you, will push you to your very limit. However, if you can successfully conquer my challenges, you'll earn an exclusive currency... I call them 'Qi Gems'. Just don't put 'em in your mouth, kid... They're highly radioactive. Heh. heh. heh... You can use the machine on your right to trade these Qi Gems for rare and powerful rewards. Sounds interesting, doesn't it? Yes... I have a feeling someone like you will enjoy this, very much... Now, if you'll excuse me... I have important business to attend to.",

        "Wow...Look how far we've come!The collection looks fantastic, and it's all thanks to you, [Player]. Here, as a way of saying 'thanks', I want to teach you something.This device will allow you to raise ostriches back home. Just place the incubator in a barn, place an ostrich egg inside, and wait... Getting your hands on an ostrich egg is a different story, though... I'll leave that up to you!Heh... Well... now the real work begins. I'll be studying these bones for years to come!Farewell, [Player]!"
